He received his doctorate of the Medical Faculty of the Ruprecht-Karls Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg in 1999. </p> <p> While working as physician in Hematology &amp; Oncology at Heidelberg University Hospital, Dr. Baudis continued his research on the molecular cytogenetics and biology of hematologic neoplasias. In January 2001, he began a postdoctoral research project at Stanford University, in the group of Prof. Michael Cleary (Department of Pathology) with focus on the functional characterisation of E2A-HLF and E2A-PBX1 fusion genes in acute lymphoblastic leukemias, using in vitro cell line models with, array based gene expression analysis as well as murine essays. This work was extended during the following position as assistant professor at the University of Florida, starting in late 2003. </p> <p> During his thesis at the DKFZ, Michael became interested in the systematic collection of genome screening data, then from the CGH experiments performed at the Lichter lab. Supported by the University of Heidelberg's Medical School, he extended those early efforts to the systematic collection of original and publication derived genomic copy number data from malignant lymphomas. The website of the progenetix.net molecular cancer cytogenetics website was launched in early 2001, accompanied by a publication in Bioinformatics. </p> <p> After the position at UF and a brief stay at the RWTH Aachen (Human Genetics; 2006-2007), since August 2007 Michael has been a group leader and Professor of Bionformatics (2015) at the Department of Molecular Life Sciences of the University of Z\u00fcrich, as well as associated with the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics SIB. </p> <p> The work of his Computational Oncogenomics group is centered on the comparative analysis of genomic profiling data in cancer, with a focus on somatic copy number variations (CNV, CNA). With the Progenetix repository, the group provides one of the largest reference resources of curated genomic profiling and associated metadata covering the majority of cancer types. </p> <p> Apart from the analysis of cancer genome data, in recent years Michael has worked to facilitate the access to genomic data for research on a global scale. Since its founding in 2014, Michael has been a member of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health GA4GH, currently serving in the steering committee and as co-lead of its \"Discovery\" workstream. Related to the work in the Global Alliance, Michael also co-chairs the ELIXIR Beacon project, which develops APIs to query genomic data collections in a privacy-protecting manner. Here, the main focus on the group is in prototyping protocol extensions with demonstrator implementation in the Beacon+ project, connected to the Progenetix repository. </p> <p> In the Swiss context, Michael has been involved in advising the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) initiative and lead its \"Bioinformatics and Data Analytics\" working group. </p>"},{"location":"group/Ni-Ai/","title":"Ni Ai","text":"Contact Address Ni AiInstitute of Molecular Life SciencesUniversity of ZurichWinterthurerstrasse 190CH-8057 ZurichSwitzerland ORCID email github web Personal Date of birth Nationality email Education 2012 \u2013 current Research thesis in theoretical cancer genomics, Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich, Switzerland Employment"},{"location":"group/Paula-Carrio-Cordo/","title":"Paula Carrio Cordo","text":"Contact Address Paula Carrio CordoInstitute of Molecular Life SciencesUniversity of ZurichWinterthurerstrasse 190CH-8057 ZurichSwitzerland ORCID email paula.carriocordo@uzh.ch github @paulacarrio Personal Date of birth 30.07.1992 Nationality Spanish Education 2021-04-21 PhD in Molecular Life Sciences of the Faculty of Sciences, University of Zurich 2017 \u2013 2021 Research thesis in theoretical cancer genomics, Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich, Switzerland 2016 \u2013 2017 Master of Science in Quantitative Biology and Systems Biology, University of Zurich, Switzerland 2013 \u2013 2014 Erasmus exchange - Bachelor of Science in Biology, University of Zurich, Switzerland 2010 \u2013 2015 Bachelor of Science in Biology, University of Oviedo, Spain Employment 08/2017 \u2013 current PhD candidate in Life Science Zurich Graduate School, University of Zurich, Switzerland 07/2017 \u2013 08/2017 Bioinformatician at European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI Hinxton), United Kingdom 06/2015 \u2013 09/2015 Research assistant at National Institute of Agricultural Research (INRA Dijon), France 06/2014 \u2013 09/2014 Research assistant at Department of Evolutionary Biology, University of Zurich, Switzerland"},{"location":"group/Qingyao-Huang/","title":"Qingyao Huang","text":"Contact Address Qingyao HuangInstitute of Molecular Life SciencesUniversity of ZurichWinterthurerstrasse 190CH-8057 ZurichSwitzerland ORCID 0000-0002-8255-4722 email qingyao.huang@uzh.ch github @qingyao Personal Nationality P.R.

This is primarily due to limitations of chromosomal banding techniques which have been the central methods for cytogenetic analysis. These techniques depend on the availability of fresh tumor tissue and the examination of metaphase cells which may not be representative for the major cell clone in vivo. In contrast, the new technique of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) allows researchers to obtain a comprehensive view of chromosomal gains and losses by analyzing tumor DNA, which can be prepared from archival tissue samples. Results of CGH studies in three different types of lymphoproliferative disorders are outlined in this paper demonstrating that: (1) in chronic B cell leukemias, chromosomal aberrations are missed by banding analysis in a high proportion of cases, (2) CGH on paraffin-embedded tissue samples can be used for cytogenetic analysis within clinical multicenter trials and (3) DNA amplifications are more frequent in NHL than previously assumed. Thus, it can be expected that CGH will contribute both to the understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms and the identification of clinically relevant chromosome aberrations in NHL.</p>","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/1995-2000/1996-01-01-Chromosome/","title":"Chromosomal-imbalances-in-papillary-RCC-and-first-CGH-of-familial-cases","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/1995-2000/1996-01-01-Chromosome/#chromosome-imbalances-in-papillary-renal-cell-carcinoma-and-first-cytogenetic-data-of-familial-cases-analyzed-by-comparative-genomic-hybridization","title":"Chromosome imbalances in papillary renal cell carcinoma and first cytogenetic data of familial cases analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization.","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/1995-2000/1996-01-01-Chromosome/#bentz-m-bergerheim-us-li-c-joos-s-werner-ca-baudis-m-gnarra-j-merino-mj-zbar-b-linehan-wm-lichter-p","title":"Bentz M, Bergerheim US, Li C, Joos S, Werner CA, Baudis M, Gnarra J, Merino MJ, Zbar B, Linehan WM, Lichter P.","text":"<p>Abstract We used comparative genomic hybridization to analyze 17 tumor samples from 11 patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC), including three patients with hereditary papillary RCC.

With increasing malignancy grade, a marked accumulation of genomic aberrations was observed; i.e., the numbers (mean +/- SEM) of total alterations detected per tumor were 2.9 +/- 0.7 for MI, 9.2 +/- 1.2 for MII, and 13.3 +/- 1.9 for MIII. The most frequent alteration detected in MI was loss on 22q (58%).

Apart from sequencing the human genome, there was also a huge increase of knowledge regarding genomic aberrations in cancer.

In addition, some aberrations are useful as clonal markers for the detection of (minimal) residual disease. However, due to limited availability of fresh lymphoma tumor tissues, there are only scarce data regarding the prognostic significance of specific genomic aberrations in lymphomas. In all these studies, chromosomal banding analyses were performed retrospectively in heterogeneous groups of patients. In contrast to such banding analyses, molecular cytogenetic techniques, such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) do not depend on the availability of fresh tumor samples.

METHODS: In order to further define specific DNA copy number changes in cervical cancer, we analyzed 20 cervical samples (3 pre-malignant lesions, 10 invasive tumors, and 7 cell lines), using the GenoSensor microarray CGH system to define particular genetic targets that suffer copy number changes. RESULTS: The most common DNA gains detected by array CGH in the invasive samples were located at the RBP1-RBP2 (3q21-q22) genes, the sub-telomeric clone C84C11/T3 (5ptel), D5S23 (5p15.2) and the DAB2 gene (5p13) in 58.8% of the samples. The most common losses were found at the FHIT gene (3p14.2) in 47% of the samples, followed by deletions at D8S504 (8p23.3), CTDP1-SHGC- 145820 (18qtel), KIT (4q11-q12), D1S427-FAF1 (1p32.3), D9S325 (9qtel), EIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, 4q24), RB1 (13q14), and DXS7132 (Xq12) present in 5/17 (29.4%) of the samples.

In this study, we aimed for comprehensive genetic subgroup discovery and assessment of independent prognostic markers based on genome-wide aberrations detected by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published CGH data from 231 primary untreated neuroblastomas were converted to a digitized format suitable for global data mining, subgroup discovery, and multivariate survival analyses. RESULTS: In contrast to previous reports, which included only a few genetic parameters, we present here for the first time a strategy that allows unbiased evaluation of all genetic imbalances detected by CGH. The presented approach firmly established the existence of three different clinicogenetic subgroups and indicated that chromosome 17 status and tumor stage were the only independent significant predictors for patient outcome. Important new findings were: (1) a normal chromosome 17 status as a delineator of a subgroup of presumed favorable-stage tumors with highly increased risk; (2) the recognition of a survivor signature conferring 100% 5-year survival for stage 1, 2, and 4S tumors presenting with whole chromosome 17 gain; and (3) the identification of 3p deletion as a hallmark of older age at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: We propose a new regression model for improved patient outcome prediction, incorporating tumor stage, chromosome 17, and amplification/deletion status. These findings may prove highly valuable with respect to more reliable risk assessment, evaluation of clinical results, and optimization of current treatment protocols.</p>","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2001-2007/2005-07-01-Genetic-losses-in/","title":"Genetic losses in...","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2001-2007/2005-07-01-Genetic-losses-in/#genetic-losses-in-breast-cancer-toward-an-integrated-molecular-cytogenetic-map","title":"Genetic losses in breast cancer: toward an integrated molecular cytogenetic map.","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2001-2007/2005-07-01-Genetic-losses-in/#mao-x-hamoudi-ra-zhao-p-baudis-m","title":"Mao X, Hamoudi RA, Zhao P, Baudis M.","text":"<p>Abstract Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease in Caucasian women, but is less frequent in Chinese women.

The goal is to develop a systematic way of placing patients with similar CGH imbalance profiles into the same cluster. Our expectation is that patients with the same cancer types will generally belong to the same cluster as their underlying CGH profiles will be similar. RESULTS: We focus on distance-based clustering strategies. We do this in two steps. (1) Distances of all pairs of CGH samples are computed. (2) CGH samples are clustered based on this distance. We develop three pairwise distance/similarity measures, namely raw, cosine and sim. Raw measure disregards correlation between contiguous genomic intervals. It compares the aberrations in each genomic interval separately. The remaining measures assume that consecutive genomic intervals may be correlated. Cosine maps pairs of CGH samples into vectors in a high-dimensional space and measures the angle between them. Sim measures the number of independent common aberrations. We test our distance/similarity measures on three well known clustering algorithms, bottom-up, top-down and k-means with and without centroid shrinking. Our results show that sim consistently performs better than the remaining measures. This indicates that the correlation of neighboring genomic intervals should be considered in the structural analysis of CGH datasets. The combination of sim with top-down clustering emerged as the best approach. AVAILABILITY: All software developed in this article and all the datasets are available from the authors upon request.

PROCEDURE: We used representational difference analysis to identify candidate E2A-HLF target genes. Transient transfection assays and an inducible expression model system were then used to evaluate the ability of E2A-HLF to modulate target gene expression. RESULTS: We identified ABCB1 (MDR1, P-glycoprotein) as a gene differentially expressed in ALL cell lines with and without E2A-HLF expression and demonstrated that t(17;19)+ ALL cell lines expressed high levels of ABCB1 protein and had a drug efflux-positive phenotype. Although ABCB1 transcription is regulated by C/EBPbeta via interaction with a DNA response element that shares significant homology with the optimal E2A-HLF binding site, E2A-HLF did not directly activate transcription of reporter genes under control of ABCB1 promoter elements in transient transfection assays. However, ABCB1 expression was induced in a DNA-binding independent manner by E2A-HLF, E2A-PBX1, and truncated E2A polypeptides consisting of those portions of E2A present in leukemic fusion proteins. CONCLUSIONS: E2A-HLF-mediated over-expression of ABCB1 may play a critical role in defining the clinical phenotype of ALLs with a t(17;19), suggesting pharmacologic modulation of ABCB1 activity as a rational therapeutic strategy for this chemotherapy resistant subtype of ALL.</p>","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2001-2007/2007-01-01-Genomic-imbalances/","title":"Genomic imbalances in 5918 malignant tumors","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2001-2007/2007-01-01-Genomic-imbalances/#genomic-imbalances-in-5918-malignant-epithelial-tumors-an-explorative-meta-analysis-of-chromosomal-cgh-data","title":"Genomic imbalances in 5918 malignant epithelial tumors: an explorative meta-analysis of chromosomal CGH data.","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2001-2007/2007-01-01-Genomic-imbalances/#baudis-m","title":"Baudis M.","text":"<p>Abstract BACKGROUND: Chromosomal abnormalities have been associated with most human malignancies, with gains and losses on some genomic regions associated with particular entities. METHODS: Of the 15429 cases collected for the Progenetix molecular-cytogenetic database, 5918 malignant epithelial neoplasias analyzed by chromosomal Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) were selected for further evaluation. For the 22 clinico-pathological entities with more than 50 cases, summary profiles for genomic imbalances were generated from case specific data and analyzed.</p> <p>RESULTS: With large variation in overall genomic instability, recurring genomic gains and losses were prominent. Most entities showed frequent gains involving 8q2, while gains on 20q, 1q, 3q, 5p, 7q and 17q were frequent in different entities. Loss \"hot spots\" included 3p, 4q, 13q, 17p and 18q among others.

CONCLUSION: Although considerable case-by-case variation of genomic profiles can be found by CGH in epithelial malignancies, a limited set of variously combined chromosomal imbalances may be typical for carcinogenesis.

Genomic aberrations occurring in more than five patients were studied for impact on locoregional progression (LRP)-free survival. p values were adjusted by the Hochberg-Benjamini procedure and significant aberrations and clinical variables subjected to a stepwise backwards Cox proportional model.

However, diagnostic dilemmas may arise in daily practice due to overlap of BL with subsets of other aggressive, mature B-cell lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Recently, two gene expression studies have described a distinct molecular profile for BL, but also showed the persistence of some cases intermediate between BL and DLBCL. An alternative approach to define BL is to consider (cyto)genetic data, in particular chromosomal abnormalities other than the t(8;14) or its variants. In this review the 'Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer,' harboring the majority of all published neoplasia-related karyotypes, was explored to define a cytogenetic profile of 'true' BL. This core subset of BL showed a very low complexity of chromosomal abnormalities with 40% of the cases having the IG-MYC fusion as the sole abnormality. In the remaining cases, additional recurrent but partially exclusive abnormalities included gains at chromosomes 1q, 7 and 12, and losses of 6q, 13q32-34 and 17p. Within the core subset, no differences were found between pediatric and adult patients. In addition, the genetic profile of the core subset was significantly different from BL with an 8q24 breakpoint not affecting one of the three immunoglobulin loci, BL with a translocation involving 18q21/BCL2, 3q27/BCL6 or 11q13/BCL1, additionally to a breakpoint at 8q24/MYC, and from other morphological types of lymphomas with an 8q24/MYC breakpoint. These groups showed a higher cytogenetic complexity than the core subset of BL. BL without a detectable 8q24/MYC breakpoint might be heterogeneous and deserves further studies. We suggest that, concordant with the WHO classification to be published in 2008, the diagnosis of BL should be restricted to cases with expression of CD10 and BCL6, absence or very weak expression of BCL2 protein, a homogeneously very high proliferation index and a proven IG-MYC translocation without evidence of a chromosomal translocation typical for other lymphoma entities. In addition, a high number of nonspecific cytogenetic abnormalities should suggest need for a critical review of the diagnosis of BL.</p>","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2009-07-01-Recurrent-loss%2C-but/","title":"Recurrent loss, but...","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2009-07-01-Recurrent-loss%2C-but/#recurrent-loss-but-lack-of-mutations-of-the-smarcb1-tumor-suppressor-gene-in-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia-with-tcl1a-tcrad-juxtaposition","title":"Recurrent loss, but lack of mutations, of the SMARCB1 tumor suppressor gene in T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia with TCL1A-TCRAD juxtaposition.","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2009-07-01-Recurrent-loss%2C-but/#bug-s-durig-j-oyen-f-klein-hitpass-l-martin-subero-ji-harder-l-baudis-m-arnold-n-kordes-u-duhrsen-u-schneppenheim-r-siebert-r","title":"Bug S, D\u00fcrig J, Oyen F, Klein-Hitpass L, Martin-Subero JI, Harder L, Baudis M, Arnold N, Kordes U, D\u00fchrsen U, Schneppenheim R, Siebert R.","text":"<p>Abstract In T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), chromosomal imbalances affecting the long arm of chromosome 22 are regarded as typical chromosomal aberrations secondary to a TCRAD-TCL1A fusion due to inv(14) or t(14;14).

RESULTS: This article develops an efficient method that can accurately model the progression of the cancer markers and reconstruct evolutionary relationship between multiple types of cancers using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data. Such modeling can lead to better understanding of the commonalities and differences between multiple cancer types and potential therapies. We have developed an automatic method to infer a graph model for the markers of multiple cancers from a large population of CGH data. Our method identifies highly related markers across different cancer types. It then builds a directed acyclic graph that shows the evolutionary history of these markers based on how common each marker is in different cancer types. We demonstrated the use of this model in determining the importance of markers in cancer evolution. We have also developed a new method to measure the evolutionary distance between different cancers based on their markers. This method employs the graph model we developed for the individual markers to measure the distance between pairs of cancers. We used this measure to create an evolutionary tree for multiple cancers. Our experiments on Progenetix database show that our markers are largely consistent to the reported hot-spot imbalances and most frequent imbalances. The results show that our distance measure can accurately reconstruct the evolutionary relationship between multiple cancer types.</p>","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2009-11-01-Quantifying-cancer/","title":"Quantifying cancer...","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2009-11-01-Quantifying-cancer/#quantifying-cancer-progression-with-conjunctive-bayesian-networks","title":"Quantifying cancer progression with conjunctive Bayesian networks.","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2009-11-01-Quantifying-cancer/#gerstung-m-baudis-m-moch-h-beerenwinkel-n","title":"Gerstung M, Baudis M, Moch H, Beerenwinkel N.","text":"<p>Abstract MOTIVATION: Cancer is an evolutionary process characterized by accumulating mutations. However, the precise timing and the order of genetic alterations that drive tumor progression remain enigmatic. RESULTS: We present a specific probabilistic graphical model for the accumulation of mutations and their interdependencies. The Bayesian network models cancer progression by an explicit unobservable accumulation process in time that is separated from the observable but error-prone detection of mutations. Model parameters are estimated by an Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the underlying interaction graph is obtained by a simulated annealing procedure. Applying this method to cytogenetic data for different cancer types, we find multiple complex oncogenetic pathways deviating substantially from simplified models, such as linear pathways or trees. We further demonstrate how the inferred progression dynamics can be used to improve genetics-based survival predictions which could support diagnostics and prognosis.

Here, we report on a patient with Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) and a paternally inherited 0.46 Mb duplication in 21q22 affecting the KCNE1 and DSCR1/RCAN genes. The identification of an involvement of KCNE1 was interesting because it encodes the beta-subunit of the KvLQT1 channel as the slow component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K(+) current. Since duplication of the KCNQ1 gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the same channel was reported recently in another SRS patient, we screened both genes for mutations in a cohort of SRS patients without detecting pathologic variants. We presume that the duplication of the two functionally linked genes in different patients with the same disorder is a coincidental finding.

LEMD3 haploinsufficiency and point mutations have been previously associated with osteopoikilosis but radiographs of our patient at the age of 16 years did not reveal any hint for osteopoikilosis lesions. Haploinsufficiency of HMGA2 is probably responsible for aberrant growth in 12q14 microdeletion syndrome.

Several studies have shown that MUC1 overexpression is due to transcriptional regulatory events. However, the importance of gene amplification as a mechanism leading to the increase of MUC1 expression in breast cancer has been poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of MUC1 gene amplification and protein expression in human breast cancer development. By means of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical methods, 83 breast tissue samples were analyzed for MUC1 gene amplification and protein expression. This analysis showed MUC1 genomic amplification and a positive association with the histopathological group in 12% (1 out of 8) of benign lesions and 38% (23 out of 60) of primary invasive breast carcinoma samples (P = 0.004). Array-comparative genomic hybridization meta-analysis of 886 primary invasive breast carcinomas obtained from 22 studies showed MUC1 genomic gain in 43.7% (387 out of 886) of the samples. Moreover, we identified a highly statistical significant association between MUC1 gene amplification and MUC1 protein expression assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot test (P &lt; 0.0001).

Since more than one CNA can be detected in most tumors, frequently co-occurring genetic CNA may point to cooperating cancer related genes. Existing methods for co-occurrence evaluation so far have not considered the overall heterogeneity of CNA per tumor, resulting in a preferential detection of frequent changes with limited specificity for each association due to the high genetic instability of many samples. METHOD: We hypothesize that in cancer some linkage-independent CNA may display a non-random co-occurrence, and that these CNA could be of pathogenetic relevance for the respective cancer. We also hypothesize that the statistical relevance of co-occurring CNA may depend on the sample specific CNA complexity. We verify our hypotheses with a simulation based algorithm CDCOCA (complexity dependence of co-occurring chromosomal aberrations). RESULTS: Application of CDCOCA to example data sets identified co-occurring CNA from low complex background which otherwise went unnoticed. Identification of cancer associated genes in these co-occurring changes can provide insights of cooperative genes involved in oncogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a method to detect associations of regional copy number abnormalities in cancer data. Along with finding statistically relevant CNA co-occurrences, our algorithm points towards a generally low specificity for co-occurrence of regional imbalances in CNA rich samples, which may have negative impact on pathway modeling approaches relying on frequent CNA events.</p>","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2011-07-01-Silver-Russell/","title":"Silver-Russell...","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2011-07-01-Silver-Russell/#silver-russell-patients-showing-a-broad-range-of-icr1-and-icr2-hypomethylation-in-different-tissues","title":"Silver-Russell patients showing a broad range of ICR1 and ICR2 hypomethylation in different tissues.","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2011-07-01-Silver-Russell/#begemann-m-spengler-s-kanber-d-haake-a-baudis-m-leisten-i-binder-g-markus-s-rupprecht-t-segerer-h-fricke-otto-s-muhlenberg-r-siebert-r-buiting-k-eggermann-t","title":"Begemann M, Spengler S, Kanber D, Haake A, Baudis M, Leisten I, Binder G, Markus S, Rupprecht T, Segerer H, Fricke-Otto S, M\u00fchlenberg R, Siebert R, Buiting K, Eggermann T.","text":"<p>Abstract In all known congenital imprinting disorders an association with aberrant methylation or mutations at specific loci was well established. However, several patients with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM), Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) exhibiting multilocus hypomethylation (MLH) have meanwhile been described. Whereas TNDM patients with MLH show clinical symptoms different from carriers with isolated 6q24 aberrations, MLH carriers diagnosed as BWS or SRS present only the syndrome-specific features. Interestingly, SRS and BWS patients with nearly identical MLH patterns in leukocytes have been identified. We now report on the molecular findings in DNA in three SRS patients with hypomethylation of both 11p15 imprinted control regions (ICRs) in leukocytes. One patient was a monozygotic (MZ) twin, another was a triplet. While the hypomethylation affected both oppositely imprinted 11p15 ICRs in leukocytes, in buccal swab DNA only the ICR1 hypomethylation was visible in two of our patients. In the non-affected MZ twin of one of these patients, aberrant methylation was also present in leukocytes but neither in buccal swab DNA nor in skin fibroblasts. Despite mutation screening of several factors involved in establishment and maintenance of methylation marks including ZFP57, MBD3, DNMT1 and DNMT3L the molecular clue for the ICR1/ICR2 hypomethylation in our patients remained unclear. Furthermore, the reason for the development of the specific SRS phenotype is not obvious.

Recent approaches to molecularly classify RCC were based on clinical, pathological as well as on single molecular parameters. As a consequence, gene expression patterns reflecting the sum of genetic aberrations in individual tumors may not have been recognized. In an attempt to uncover such molecular features in RCC, we used a novel, unbiased and integrative approach. METHODS: We integrated gene expression data from 97 primary RCC of different pathologic parameters, 15 RCC metastases as well as 34 cancer cell lines for two-way nonsupervised hierarchical clustering using gene groups suggested by the PANTHER Classification System. We depicted the genomic landscape of the resulted tumor groups by means of Single Nuclear Polymorphism (SNP) technology. Finally, the achieved results were immunohistochemically analyzed using a tissue microarray (TMA) composed of 254 RCC. RESULTS: We found robust, genome wide expression signatures, which split RCC into three distinct molecular subgroups. These groups remained stable even if randomly selected gene sets were clustered. Notably, the pattern obtained from RCC cell lines was clearly distinguishable from that of primary tumors. SNP array analysis demonstrated differing frequencies of chromosomal copy number alterations among RCC subgroups. TMA analysis with group-specific markers showed a prognostic significance of the different groups.

Besides specifically targeting well-known, canonical oncogenes, CNAs may also play more subtle roles in terms of modulating genetic potential and broad gene expression patterns of developing tumors. Any significant differences in the overall CNA patterns between different cancer types may thus point towards specific biological mechanisms acting in those cancers. In addition, differences among CNA profiles may prove valuable for cancer classifications beyond existing annotation systems. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have analyzed molecular-cytogenetic data from 25579 tumors samples, which were classified into 160 cancer types according to the International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding system. When correcting for differences in the overall CNA frequencies between cancer types, related cancers were often found to cluster together according to similarities in their CNA profiles. Based on a randomization approach, distance measures from the cluster dendrograms were used to identify those specific genomic regions that contributed significantly to this signal. This approach identified 43 non-neutral genomic regions whose propensity for the occurrence of copy number alterations varied with the type of cancer at hand. Only a subset of these identified loci overlapped with previously implied, highly recurrent (hot-spot) cytogenetic imbalance regions. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, for many genomic regions, a simple null-hypothesis of independence between cancer type and relative copy number alteration frequency can be rejected. Since a subset of these regions display relatively low overall CNA frequencies, they may point towards second-tier genomic targets that are adaptively relevant but not necessarily essential for cancer development.</p>","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2012-01-01-arrayMap-a/","title":"arrayMap: a...","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2012-01-01-arrayMap-a/#arraymap-a-reference-resource-for-genomic-copy-number-imbalances-in-human-malignancies","title":"arrayMap: a reference resource for genomic copy number imbalances in human malignancies.","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2012-01-01-arrayMap-a/#cai-h-kumar-n-baudis-m","title":"Cai H, Kumar N, Baudis M.","text":"<p>Abstract BACKGROUND: The delineation of genomic copy number abnormalities (CNAs) from cancer samples has been instrumental for identification of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes and proven useful for clinical marker detection.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We here present arrayMap, a curated reference database and bioinformatics resource targeting copy number profiling data in human cancer. The arrayMap database provides a platform for meta-analysis and systems level data integration of high-resolution oncogenomic CNA data. To date, the resource incorporates more than 40,000 arrays in 224 cancer types extracted from several resources, including the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), EBI's ArrayExpress (AE), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), publication supplements and direct submissions. For the majority of the included datasets, probe level and integrated visualization facilitate gene level and genome wide data review. Results from multi-case selections can be connected to downstream data analysis and visualization tools.

One additional case study was identified from contact with experts. Individual patient data were extracted from publications or obtained from investigators, and CNAs were converted to a digitized format suitable for data mining and subgroup identification. Summary profiles for genomic imbalances were generated from case-specific data. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and by univariable and multivariable Cox regression models. In their overall CNA profiles, low grade tumors of the pineal region clearly diverged from CNS-PNET and pineoblastoma.

Multivariable analysis revealed that histology (CNS-PNET), age (\u22642.5 years), and possibly recurrent CNAs were associated with unfavorable OS.

It is not clear in detail which signaling pathways or networks regulate the induction of either apoptosis or senescence. Primary human fibroblasts are able to withstand high doses of irradiation and to prevent irradiation-induced apoptosis. However, the underlying regulatory basis for this phenotype is not well understood. Here, a kinetic network analysis based on reverse phase protein arrays (RPPAs) in combination with extensive western blot and cell culture analyses was employed to decipher the cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling networks and to identify possible antiapoptotic pathways. This analysis identified activation of known DNA damage response pathways (e.g., phosphorylation of MKK3/6, p38, MK2, Hsp27, p53 and Chk1) as well as of prosurvival (e.g., MEK-ERK, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), protein kinase C (PKC)) and antiapoptotic markers (e.g., Bad, Bcl-2). Interestingly, PKC family members were activated early upon irradiation, suggesting a regulatory function in the ionizing radiation (IR) response of these cells. Inhibition or downregulation of PKC in primary human fibroblasts caused IR-dependent downregulation of the identified prosurvival (CREB phosphorylation) and antiapoptotic (Bad phosphorylation, Bcl-2) markers and thus lead to a proliferation stop and to apoptosis. Taken together, our analysis suggests that cytoplasmic PKC signaling conditions IR-stressed MRC-5 and IMR-90 cells to prevent irradiation-induced apoptosis. These findings contribute to the understanding of the cellular and nuclear IR response and may thus eventually improve the efficacy of radiotherapy and help overcome tumor radioresistance.</p>","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2013-02-01-High-resolution-copy/","title":"High resolution copy...","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2013-02-01-High-resolution-copy/#high-resolution-copy-number-analysis-of-irf4-translocation-positive-diffuse-large-b-cell-and-follicular-lymphomas","title":"High resolution copy number analysis of IRF4 translocation-positive diffuse large B-cell and follicular lymphomas.","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2013-02-01-High-resolution-copy/#salaverria-i-martin-guerrero-i-burkhardt-b-kreuz-m-zenz-t-oschlies-i-arnold-n-baudis-m-bens-s-garcia-orad-a-lisfeld-j-schwaenen-c-szczepanowski-m-wessendorf-s-pfreundschuh-m-trumper-l-klapper-w-siebert-r","title":"Salaverria I, Martin-Guerrero I, Burkhardt B, Kreuz M, Zenz T, Oschlies I, Arnold N, Baudis M, Bens S, Garc\u00eda-Orad A, Lisfeld J, Schwaenen C, Szczepanowski M, Wessendorf S, Pfreundschuh M, Tr\u00fcmper L, Klapper W, Siebert R.","text":"<p>Abstract Translocations affecting chromosome subband 6p25.3 containing the IRF4 gene have been recently described as characteristic alterations in a molecularly distinct subset of germinal center B-cell-derived lymphomas.

More recently, mutations in the SIL1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum resident co-chaperone, were identified as the main cause of Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. Here we describe the results of SIL1 mutation analysis in 62 patients presenting with early-onset ataxia, cataracts and myopathy or combinations of at least two of these. We obtained a mutation detection rate of 60% (15/25) among patients with the characteristic Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome triad (ataxia, cataracts, myopathy) whereas the detection rate in the group of patients with more variable phenotypic presentation was below 3% (1/37). We report 16 unrelated families with a total of 19 different SIL1 mutations. Among these mutations are 15 previously unreported changes, including single- and multi-exon deletions. Based on data from our screening cohort and data compiled from the literature we found that SIL1 mutations are invariably associated with the combination of a cerebellar syndrome and chronic myopathy. Cataracts were observed in all patients beyond the age of 7 years, but might be missing in infants. Six patients with SIL1 mutations had no intellectual disability, extending the known wide range of cognitive capabilities in Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome to include normal intelligence. Modestly constant features were somatic growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities and pyramidal tract signs. Examination of mutant SIL1 expression in cultured patient lymphoblasts suggested that SIL1 mutations result in severely reduced SIL1 protein levels irrespective of the type and position of mutations. Our data broaden the SIL1 mutation spectrum and confirm that SIL1 is the major Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome gene. SIL1 patients usually present with the characteristic triad but cataracts might be missing in young children. As cognitive impairment is not obligatory, patients without intellectual disability but a Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome-compatible phenotype should receive SIL1 mutation analysis. Despite allelic heterogeneity and many families with private mutations, the phenotype related to SIL1 mutations is relatively homogenous. Based on SIL1 expression studies we speculate that this may arise from a uniform effect of different mutations on protein expression.</p>","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Biopsying-parapsoria/","title":"Biopsying parapsoria...","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Biopsying-parapsoria/#biopsying-parapsoriasis-quo-vadis-are-morphological-stains-enough-or-are-ancillary-tests-needed","title":"Biopsying parapsoriasis: quo vadis?

It was first named by Brocq, in 1902, as an entity with three components: pityriasis lichenoides, small plaque parapsoriasis and large plaque parapsoriasis. Nowadays, under the name of parapsoriasis are included only the last two categories, that are considered disorders characterized by the presence of a mononuclear infiltrate in the dermis, composed of T-cells. Until now, there were not established pathognomonic histopathological features to diagnose parapsoriasis. AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate the epidemiological and morphological data of parapsoriasis cases diagnosed at Emergency City Hospital, Timisoara, Romania for a period of 12 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study had two parts; one was retrospective and another one prospective. For the retrospective part, we searched 210111 patient files recorded in our Pathology Service for a period of 11 years, from January 2002 to December 2012. The slides were searched from the archive and re-read by two individual pathologists. For prospective part of the study, we reviewed 11815 histological slides read between January and June 2013. After inspection of the recorded files, the pathologists noted, were available, the localization and number of the lesions, together with symptoms. The biopsied specimens were initially processed with routine histological technique, the archive slides being stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. While reading the slides, the pathologists paid attention to the architecture of the epidermis, the presence of epidermotropism and interface dermatitis, type of the dermal infiltrate and its distributions. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we emphasized the histopathological aspects of parapsoriasis in order to create a basic line that could help in the establishment of a uniformly accepted definition of parapsoriasis on histopathological grounds.</p>","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Chromothripsis-like/","title":"Chromothripsis-like...","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Chromothripsis-like/#chromothripsis-like-patterns-are-recurring-but-heterogeneously-distributed-features-in-a-survey-of-22347-cancer-genome-screens","title":"Chromothripsis-like patterns are recurring but heterogeneously distributed features in a survey of 22,347 cancer genome screens.","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Chromothripsis-like/#cai-h-kumar-n-bagheri-hc-von-mering-c-robinson-md-baudis-m","title":"Cai H, Kumar N, Bagheri HC, von Mering C, Robinson MD, Baudis M.","text":"<p>Abstract BACKGROUND: Chromothripsis is a recently discovered phenomenon of genomic rearrangement, possibly arising during a single genome-shattering event. This could provide an alternative paradigm in cancer development, replacing the gradual accumulation of genomic changes with a \"one-off\" catastrophic event. However, the term has been used with varying operational definitions, with the minimal consensus being a large number of locally clustered copy number aberrations. The mechanisms underlying these chromothripsis-like patterns (CTLP) and their specific impact on tumorigenesis are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we identified CTLP in 918 cancer samples, from a dataset of more than 22,000 oncogenomic arrays covering 132 cancer types. Fragmentation hotspots were found to be located on chromosome 8, 11, 12 and 17. Among the various cancer types, soft-tissue tumors exhibited particularly high CTLP frequencies. Genomic context analysis revealed that CTLP rearrangements frequently occurred in genomes that additionally harbored multiple copy number aberrations (CNAs). An investigation into the affected chromosomal regions showed a large proportion of arm-level pulverization and telomere related events, which would be compatible to a number of underlying mechanisms. We also report evidence that these genomic events may be correlated with patient age, stage and survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: Through a large-scale analysis of oncogenomic array data sets, this study characterized features associated with genomic aberrations patterns, compatible to the spectrum of \"chromothripsis\"-definitions as previously used. While quantifying clustered genomic copy number aberrations in cancer samples, our data indicates an underlying biological heterogeneity behind these chromothripsis-like patterns, beyond a well defined \"chromthripsis\" phenomenon.</p>","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Progenetix-12-years/","title":"Progenetix: 12 years...","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Progenetix-12-years/#progenetix-12-years-of-oncogenomic-data-curation","title":"Progenetix: 12 years of oncogenomic data curation.","text":"","tags":["article"]},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Progenetix-12-years/#cai-h-kumar-n-ai-n-gupta-s-rath-p-baudis-m","title":"Cai H, Kumar N, Ai N, Gupta S, Rath P, Baudis M.","text":"<p>Abstract DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) can be found in the majority of cancer genomes and are crucial for understanding the potential mechanisms underlying tumor initiation and progression.

Chromosomal instability contributed in part to the altered gene expression in SAOS and LM5 cells with low and high metastatic potential. To identify metastasis-relevant genes in a background of passage-dependent altered gene expression, genes involved in \"Pathways in cancer\" that were consistently regulated under all passage comparisons were evaluated. Genes belonging to \"Hedgehog signaling pathway\" and \"Wnt signaling pathway\" were significantly up-regulated, and IHH, WNT10B and TCF7 were found up-regulated in all three metastatic compared to the parental cell lines.Considerable instability during culture in terms of gene expression and chromosomal aberrations was observed in osteosarcoma cell lines.
