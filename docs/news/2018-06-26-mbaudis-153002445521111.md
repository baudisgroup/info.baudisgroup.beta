<!--  CONTENT  -->

To unify the general website handling processes, I've implemented some changes:

<!--more-->

* The [info.progenetix.org](http://info.progenetix.org) site has been removed from Github and is now also being built from a Dropbox directory and hosted on the main server. This went along with a change in the `http.conf` (e.g. local _info.progenetix.test_).
* The sources for the __Jekyll__ driven domains reside now in `~/Dropbox (baudisgroup)/baudisgroup/www_in/`.
