## Beacon v2 - Towards Flexible Use and Clinical Applications for a Reference Genomic Data Sharing Protocol
#### [Personalized Health Technologies 2020](https://www.personalizedhealth.nexus.ethz.ch)
### Michael Baudis

Beacons provide discovery services for genomic data using the Beacon API developed under
the leadership of ELIXIR, as a key driver project of the Global Alliance for Genomics and
Health (GA4GH). The Beacon protocol itself defines an open standard for genomics data
discovery. It provides a framework for public web services responding to queries against
genomic data collections, for instance from population based or disease specific genome
repositories. Sites offering beacons can scale through aggregation in "Beacon Networks",
which distribute single genome queries among a potentially large number of international
beacons and assemble their responses.

As part of ELIXIRâ€™s Beacon 2019-21 project work has started on a radically re-designed
Beacon protocol, with the aim to provide a maximum of flexibility while closely adhering
to data and security standards promoted by the international research community, and
especially as part of projects in the GA4GH ecosystem. Upcoming features have been designed
with view to biomedical applications, e.g. for variant evidence and annotation data or the
retrieval of phenotype and other clinical data when used in secure (network) environments.

Recently, the efficient use of the Beacon protocol for non-human genome data has been
demonstrated for COVID-19 repositories, showcasing the flexibility of the protocol.

Here I will provide an overview about the history, current status future directions of the
Beacon protocol, including details about the Beacon+ service on top of the [progenetix.org](http://progenetix.org)
cancer genomics resource.
