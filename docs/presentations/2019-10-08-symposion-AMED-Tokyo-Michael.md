#### Mini-Symposium about CNV and Data Standards at [AMED Japan, Tokyo](https://www.amed.go.jp/en/index.html)
##  Cancer Genomics and Implementation of Data Driven Standards for Genomic Data Exchange
### Michael Baudis

At this meeting, several Japanese participants presented their research and 
results, with a focus on Copy Number Variants and other structural genome 
variations.

Michael presented the overarching work of the group, from curating & analyzing 
cancer CNV datasets towards the projects (Beacon, Schemablocks, h-CNV) to enable 
sharing of these and other types of genomic data.
