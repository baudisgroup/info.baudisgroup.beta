**Abstract** We used comparative genomic hybridization to analyze 17 tumor samples from 11 patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC), including three patients with hereditary papillary RCC. Whereas the most frequent aberrations confirmed data obtained by banding analyses, copy number increases on 5q, which previously were considered characteristic of nonpapillary RCC, were identified in two cases. In two complex cases belonging to the same family, a characteristic pattern of chromosomal aberrations was found: five of the six imbalances present in the less complex case were included in the karyotype of the other case, suggesting a genetically determined mechanism resulting in genomic instability of specific chromosomes or chromosomal subregions and/or selection of specific mutations.
