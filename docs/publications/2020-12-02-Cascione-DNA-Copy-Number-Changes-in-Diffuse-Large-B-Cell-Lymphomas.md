#### Abstract

Copy number aberrations (CNV/CNA) represent a major contribution to the somatic mutation landscapes in cancers, and their identification can lead to the discovery of oncogenetic targets as well as improved disease (sub-) classification. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma in Western Countries and up to 40% of the affected individuals still succumb to the disease. DLBCL is an heterogenous group of disorders, and we call DLBCL today is not necessarily the same disease of a few years ago. This review focuses on types and frequencies of regional DNA CNVs in DLBCL, not otherwise specified, and in two particular conditions, the transformation from indolent lymphomas and the DLBCL in individuals with immunodeficiency.
