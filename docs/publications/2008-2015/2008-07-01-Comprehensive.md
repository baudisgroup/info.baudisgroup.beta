**Abstract** Gangliogliomas are generally benign neuroepithelial tumors composed of dysplastic neuronal and neoplastic glial elements. We screened 61 gangliogliomas [World Health Organization (WHO) grade I] for genomic alterations by chromosomal and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Aberrations were detected in 66% of gangliogliomas (mean +/- SEM = 2.5 +/- 0.5 alterations/tumor). Frequent gains were on chromosomes 7 (21%), 5 (16%), 8 (13%), 12 (12%); frequent losses on 22q (16%), 9 (10%), 10 (8%). Recurrent partial imbalances comprised the minimal overlapping regions dim(10)(q25) and enh(12)(q13.3-q14.1). Unsupervised cluster analysis of genomic profiles detected two major subgroups (group I: complete gain of 7 and additional gains of 5, 8 or 12; group II: no major recurring imbalances, mainly losses). A comparison with low-grade gliomas (astrocytomas WHO grade II) showed chromosome 5 gain to be significantly more frequent in gangliogliomas. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) identified the aberrations to be contained in a subpopulation of glial but not in neuronal cells. Two gangliogliomas and their anaplastic recurrences (WHO grade III) were analyzed. Losses of CDKN2A/B and DMBT1 or a gain/amplification of CDK4 found in the anaplastic tumors were already present in the respective gangliogliomas by array CGH and interphase FISH. In summary, genomic profiling in a large series of gangliogliomas could distinguish genetic subgroups even in this low-grade tumor.
