# [Welcome to the _baudisgroup_ Pages](http://info.baudisgroup.org)

The _baudisgroup_ website represents projects and information by the __Computational Oncogenomics Group__ of the [University of Zurich (UZH)](https://www.mls.uzh.ch/en/research/baudis/) and the [Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB)](https://www.sib.swiss/baudis-michael/). For visitors more interested in Particle Astrophysics, we strongly recommend the website of another, although related, [Professor Baudis](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/groups/baudis.html).

Our work centres around our [Progenetix](http://progenetix.org) resource of curated molecular-cytogenetic and sequencing data. Specific projects explore computational methods, genomics of selected tumour entities and genomic variant patterns across malignancies. As members of the [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health](http://ga4gh.org), the group is developing standards in biocuration and data sharing for genomic variants and phenotypic data, for instance in driving development of the [ELIXIR Beacon](https://beacon-project.io) project. Other research is related to genome data epistemology, e.g. geographic and diagnostic sampling biases in cancer studies.

### Some Projects
