Abstract \u00b6 Over the last decade, techniques for the genome wide scanning for genomic imbalances in malignant neoplasia have been developed, e.g. Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH). Currently, no comprehensive online source for CGH data with a standardized format suitable for data mining procedures has been made available for public access. Such a data repository could be valuable in identifying genetic aberration patterns with linkage to specific disease entities, and provide additional information for validating data from large scale expression array experiments. A case and band specific aberration matrix was selected as most suitable format for the mining of CGH data. The [progenetix.net] data repository was developed to provide the according data to the research community for a growing number of human malignancies. In the current implementation, two main purposes are being served. First, access to the band specific pattern of chromosomal imbalances allows the instantaneous identification of genomic \u201chotspots\u201d. Second, the band specific aberration matrices can be included in data mining efforts. As an example, the clustering off all informative cases from the current (September 2001) dataset is shown here (online source under www.progenetix.net/bcats/clustered.png ). Data selection PubMed is searched for publications applying CGH to the analysis of malignant tumors. Articles are selected according to their online availability and the description of genomic imbalances on a per case basis. Transformation of input data Chromosomal aberration data is transformed via customized parsing commands to a common format adherent to ISCN 1995 recommendations. In some cases, aberration data was transcribed from graphical representations or provided by the authors. Data storage Currently, the primary data is stored in a dedicated \u201coff-line\u201d database. Besides case identifier and ISCN adapted chromosomal imbalance data, tumor classification and source information including the PubMed identifier is recorded. Disease entities are reclassified to ICD-O-3 codes. Text parsing and generation of aberration matrix For the generation of the case and band specific aberration matrix, a dedicated text pattern comparison model was developed using Perl. Briefly, for each chromosomal band, the aberration field of each case is searched for a variety of patterns containing aberration information applying to that band. A matrix with currently 324 band resolution is generated, annotating chromosomal gains with \u201c1\u201d and losses with \u201c\u20131\u201d; localized high- level gains are designated \u201c2\u201c. Website generation For graphical representation of chromosomal imbalances, HTML pages containing different views of the underlying aberration matrices are generated using Perl. Graphics are implemented using HTML syntax. Besides band specific, whole genomic overviews, chromosome specific pages with links to all involved cases are generated for each ICD-O-3 entity as well as for each registered project. Additionally, those representations are available for several subsets combining related data (e.g. all lymphoid neoplasias, breast carcinoma cases). For each of the groups, the according aberration matrix is linked for download.","title":"BCATS 2001 - progenetix.net: storage and visualization of genomic aberration data in human malignancies"},{"location":"presentations/2001-10-20-Michael_Baudis__progenetix.net-at-BCATS/#progenetixnet-storage-and-visualization-of-genomic-aberration-data-in-human-malignancies","text":"","title":"progenetix.net: storage and visualization of genomic aberration data in human malignancies"},{"location":"presentations/2001-10-20-Michael_Baudis__progenetix.net-at-BCATS/#michael-baudis","text":"Note Down memory lane, for historical reference: The first public presentation of the Progenetix database.","title":"Michael Baudis"},{"location":"presentations/2016-03-17-poster-saumya/","text":"VIB Conference \"Applied Bioinformatics in Life Sciences\" \u00b6 Gene-based analysis of focal copy number aberration patterns in cancer genomes \u00b6 Saumya Gupta \u00b6 Abstract \u00b6 Poster about the project to evaluate focal copy number variants in cancer, based on data from arraymap.org","title":"2016 03 17 poster saumya"},{"location":"presentations/2016-03-17-poster-saumya/#gene-based-analysis-of-focal-copy-number-aberration-patterns-in-cancer-genomes","text":"","title":"Gene-based analysis of focal copy number aberration patterns in cancer genomes"},{"location":"presentations/2016-03-17-poster-saumya/#saumya-gupta","text":"","title":"Saumya Gupta"},{"location":"presentations/2016-04-14-talk-biocuration2016-michael/","text":"Biocuration 2016, Geneva \u00b6 Harvesting Cancer Genome Data \u00b6 Michael Baudis \u00b6 Abstract \u00b6 While the analysis of cancer genomes using high-throughput technologies has generated tens of thousands of oncogenomic profiles, meta-analyses of datasets is greatly inhibited through limited data access, technical fragmentation and a multitude of raw data and annotation formats.

A central component is the development of standardised data schemas and application programming interfaces (APIs), for molecular screening data as well as biological and technical metadata. In addition to direct schema development, demonstration projects explore strategies and limitations of federated data access and attempt to engage active participants from different areas of biomedical research and clinical practice as well as experts from areas such as computer and network security, law and ethics. One of the main demonstrators has been the \u201cBeacon\u201d project, which through a lightweight \u201cbeacon-network\u201d registry and API allows the querying for specific genome sequence variants at resources from all over the world. Early on, the main focus of GA4GH was on demonstrating functionality and to engage participants through through low-complexity scenarios. However, increased utility of GA4GH schemas requires representation of common biological, health specific and technical metadata. The Metadata Task Team (MTT) of the GA4GH Data Working Group (DWG) has been working on defining the part of the schema representation which not primarily addresses primary or derived \u201comics\u201d (e.g. sequences, variants) data. Core principles of schema development have been the restriction of schema complexity, the use of standardised data formats (e.g. ISO time), and the prominent use of ontologies as externally maintained value descriptors. An important benchmark for a given data schema is the successful projection of reference datasets. However, so far the mapping of rich metadata attributes and structures into the GA4GH schema has not been explored for large, real world datasets or reference repositories. As part of an ELIXIR \u201chuman data implementation study\u201d, we have started to implement datasets as schema-compatible resources, and to explore linking these to external reference services for biomedical ontologies. At the core of this project, we are using the arraymap.org reference database for molecular genomic profiling data in cancer, which contains data from oncogenomic copy number analyses and curated metadata. The study has been directed at testing the GA4GH object model, with a focus on metadata, and at using this experience to guide schema development efforts of the GA4GH MTT. Additionally, as part of a parallel ELIXIR study, our GA4GH conform representation arrayMap data tests forward looking developments of genomic \"Beacons\", with focus on structural genome variants, the inclusion of metadata parameters for data queries, and the development of query interfaces and informative Beacon response formats. At the present time, our test implementation represents >55\u2019000 genomic call sets and allows the direct use of variant and metadata queries against a set of database collections implemented in MongoDB. A first API implementation provides responses to Beacon-style queries, e.g. the frequency of a variant for a tumor type specified through an ontology term. Ongoing efforts aim to promote rapid evolution of the GA4GH metadata schema for a variety of data types and proposed use cases, such as geolocation data, metagenomic applications and temporal relations. On the implementation side, next steps include the integration of ontology services for data query and ingestion scenarios, as well as the extension of the demonstrator API for rich metadata query scenarios. An important part of current and future developments will be the use of additional data resources for demonstration projects. Example datasets as well as tools and documentation are made available through the \u201carraymap2ga4gh\u201d project on Github . Highlights \u00b6 This presentation will be aimed at reporting the current status of the GA4GH schema development with focus on the lessons learned from the data implementation studies, as well as the challenges from design and implementation of data concepts centred around modern object based biodata data standards with heavy dependency on ontologies. We hope to excite the audience about the ongoing developments at GA4GH, with emphasis on increased engagement in data sharing activities.","title":"2017 09 13 talk bc2 michael"},{"location":"presentations/2017-09-13-talk-bc2-michael/#advancing-the-global-alliance-for-genomics-and-health-data-schemas-through-data-driven-implementations","text":"","title":"Advancing the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health data schemas through data-driven implementations"},{"location":"presentations/2017-09-13-talk-bc2-michael/#michael-baudis","text":"","title":"Michael Baudis"},{"location":"presentations/2017-09-19-talk-michael/","text":"UZH BIO390 \"Introduction to Bioinformatics\" \u00b6 Bioinformatics - Introduction \u00b6 Michael Baudis \u00b6 Abstract \u00b6 First lecture in the UZH BIO390 \"Introduction to Bioinformatics\" series, introducing concepts and scope of bioinformatics as a field.","title":"2017 09 19 talk michael"},{"location":"presentations/2017-09-19-talk-michael/#bioinformatics-introduction","text":"","title":"Bioinformatics - Introduction"},{"location":"presentations/2017-09-19-talk-michael/#michael-baudis","text":"","title":"Michael Baudis"},{"location":"presentations/2017-10-15-talk-ga4gh-michael/","text":"GA4GH 2017 Plenary / Workstream Day \u00b6 Developing Beacons for Data Discovery \u00b6 Michael Baudis \u00b6","title":"2017 10 15 talk ga4gh michael"},{"location":"presentations/2017-10-15-talk-ga4gh-michael/#developing-beacons-for-data-discovery","text":"","title":"Developing Beacons for Data Discovery"},{"location":"presentations/2017-10-15-talk-ga4gh-michael/#michael-baudis","text":"","title":"Michael Baudis"},{"location":"presentations/2017-12-01-talk-lszgs-michael/","text":"UZH Cancer Biology course \"Research with clinical samples \u00b6 Personalised Medicine - Genome Variation / Data Formats / Resources / Sharing / Privacy \u00b6 Michael Baudis \u00b6 Abstract \u00b6 Personalised Medicine - Genome Variation / Data Formats / Resources / Sharing / Privacy, presented for PhD program in Cancer Biology","title":"2017 12 01 talk lszgs michael"},{"location":"presentations/2017-12-01-talk-lszgs-michael/#personalised-medicine-genome-variation-data-formats-resources-sharing-privacy","text":"","title":"Personalised Medicine - Genome Variation / Data Formats / Resources / Sharing / Privacy"},{"location":"presentations/2017-12-01-talk-lszgs-michael/#michael-baudis","text":"","title":"Michael Baudis"},{"location":"presentations/2017-12-07-talk-timisoara-michael/","text":"Special seminar at University of Timisoara Dermatology \u00b6 Cancer Genome (Data) Analysis in Personalised Medicine \u00b6 Michael Baudis \u00b6 Abstract \u00b6 General presentation about challenges and possibilities of cancer genome screening for medical applications.","title":"2017 12 07 talk timisoara michael"},{"location":"presentations/2017-12-07-talk-timisoara-michael/#cancer-genome-data-analysis-in-personalised-medicine","text":"","title":"Cancer Genome (Data) Analysis in Personalised Medicine"},{"location":"presentations/2017-12-07-talk-timisoara-michael/#michael-baudis","text":"","title":"Michael Baudis"},{"location":"presentations/2018-02-15-talk-DPPH-michael/","text":"DPPH - Data Protection in Personalized Health 2018 , Lausanne \u00b6 Genome Beacons for Data Discovery - Technical advances in a challenging environment \u00b6 Michael Baudis \u00b6 Abstract \u00b6 The core mission of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health is to \"...enable genomic data sharing for the benefit of human health\".

Thousands of established cell lines are available from commercial or academic providers, covering a wide selection of cancer types. However, conclusions about biological pathways or pharmacological potential depend on a close molecular relation between the cancer type represented and the cell line model used for analyses. The validity of cell line based observations depends therefore A) on the correct identification and lineage assignment, and B) on the conservation of cancer specific molecular alterations during cell line propagation. However, according to ICLAC (International Cell Line Authentication Committee), in a text-based survey of ~32,000 publications for 488 cell lines, a large proportion of cell lines was found to be misidentified. In the current study, we perform a data-driven assessment of heterogeneity and similarities in-between cell lines, as well as a comparison of cell lines with primary tumor samples of same tumor type. Our study is based on the curation of genomic copy number profiling and metadata data from 3675 genome profiling experiments from our arrayMap resource , representing 1539 distinct cell lines as identified in the Cellosaurus database.

Thousands of established cell lines are available from commercial or academic providers, covering a wide selection of cancer types. However, conclusions about biological pathways or pharmacological potential depend on a close molecular relation between the cancer type represented and the cell line model used for analyses. The validity of cell line based observations depends therefore A) on the correct identification and lineage assignment, and B) on the conservation of cancer specific molecular alterations during cell line propagation. However, according to ICLAC (International Cell Line Authentication Committee), in a text-based survey of ~32,000 publications for 488 cell lines, a large proportion of cell lines was found to be misidentified. In the current study, we perform a data-driven assessment of heterogeneity and similarities in-between cell lines, as well as a comparison of cell lines with primary tumor samples of same tumor type. Our study is based on the curation of genomic copy number profiling and metadata data from 3675 genome profiling experiments from our arrayMap resource , representing 1539 distinct cell lines as identified in the Cellosaurus database.

One of the instruments to enact this mission is the selection and support of driver projects, which address particular scientific, technical, regulatory or security related aspects of federated access to human genomes and related metadata. The \"Beacon\" project had been initiated at the first GA4GH plenary in 2014, to test the willingness of genome resource providers to allow web-based queries in the most simple format, against aggregated genome variant data. While this particular model had limited practical utility, it established the foundation for automated queries against world-wide data resources, using a unified protocol. A secondary aspect of the Beacon project was the, intentional, challenge of existing notions of data security and privacy protection, including possible re-identification attacks and risk mitigation scenarios. Now continued through the ELIXIR-Beacon GA4GH driver project, extensions to the Beacon protocol will provide real-world utility for genome resource access under a number of different usage scenarios. With its support for developing the Beacon protocol and distributing it throughout its members, ELIXIR is providing one of the first, widespread implementations of a GA4GH related products.

While germline CNVs are a majorcontributor to genomic syndromes and inherited diseases, the majority of cancersaccumulate extensive \u201dsomatic\u201d CNV (sCNV or CNA) during the process ofoncogenetic transformation and progression. While specific sCNV have closelybeen associated with tumorigenesis, intriguingly many neoplasias exhibitrecurrent sCNV patterns beyond the involvement of a few cancer driver genes.Currently, CNV profiles of tumor samples are generated using genomicmicro-arrays or high-throughput DNA sequencing. Regardless of the underlyingtechnology, genomic copy number data is derived from the relative assessmentand integration of multiple signals, with the data generation process being proneto contamination from several sources. Estimated copy number values have noabsolute and linear correlation to their corresponding DNA levels, and the extentof deviation differs between sample profiles which poses a great challenge fordata integration and comparison in large scale genome analysis. Results : In this study, we present a novel method named Minimum ErrorCalibration and Normalization of Copy Numbers Analysis (Mecan4CNA). Foreach sCNV profile,Mecan4CNAreduces the noise level, calculates valuesrepresenting the normal DNA copies (baseline) and the change of one copy (leveldistance), and finally normalizes all values. Experiments ofMecan4CNAonsimulated data showed an overall accuracy of 93% and 91% in determining thebaseline and level distance, respectively. Comparison of baseline and level distanceestimation with existing methods and karyotyping data on the NCI-60 tumor cellline produced coherent results. To estimate the method\u2019s impact on downstreamanalyses we performed GISTIC analyses on original andMecan4CNAdata fromthe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) where the normalized data showed prominentimprovements of both sensitivity and specificity in detecting focal regions. Conclusions : In general,Mecan4CNAprovides an advanced method for CNAdata normalization especially in research involving data of high volume andheterogeneous quality. With its informative output and visualization, it can alsofacilitate analysis of individual CNA profiles.Mecan4CNAis freely available as aPython package and through Github.","title":"Minimum Error Calibration and Normalization for Genomic Copy Number Analysis"},{"location":"presentations/2019-09-10-poster-Basel-Bo/#minimum-error-calibration-and-normalization-for-genomic-copy-number-analysis","text":"","title":"Minimum Error Calibration and Normalization for Genomic Copy Number Analysis"},{"location":"presentations/2019-09-10-poster-Basel-Bo/#bo-gao","text":"","title":"Bo Gao"},{"location":"presentations/2019-09-10-poster-Qingyao/","text":"BC2 2019, Basel \u00b6 Cancer cell lines in focus: somatic copy number & germline variation \u00b6 Qingyao Huang \u00b6 Abstract \u00b6 Background : Human cell lines are convenient model systems in cancer research, for validation of proposed molecular mechanisms as well as to evaluate potential therapeutic approaches, e.g. through high- throughput screening of potential anti-tumour compounds against cancer cell line panels.

The Beacon protocol itself defines an open standard for genomics data discovery. It provides a framework for public web services responding to queries against genomic data collections, for instance from population based or disease specific genome repositories. Sites offering beacons can scale through aggregation in \"Beacon Networks\", which distribute single genome queries among a potentially large number of international beacons and assemble their responses. As part of ELIXIR\u2019s Beacon 2019-21 project work has started on a radically re-designed Beacon protocol, with the aim to provide a maximum of flexibility while closely adhering to data and security standards promoted by the international research community, and especially as part of projects in the GA4GH ecosystem. Upcoming features have been designed with view to biomedical applications, e.g. for variant evidence and annotation data or the retrieval of phenotype and other clinical data when used in secure (network) environments.

This information can only be provided through the inclusion of data from a multitude of genome resources in variant evaluation efforts, including such from outside (international) jurisdictions. However, opening such resources carries the inherent risk of breaching privacy, particularly through re-identification of individuals or their relatives and potentially through the exposure of individual genome-related personal information including phenotypic and \"performance\" prediction and relative disease risk. On the other hand, direct-to-consumer (DTC) testing has found widespread use with millions of individuals depositing some kind of genotyping data in open or closed repositories, thereby facilitating \"long-range re-identification attacks\" against individuals through identification of their relatives. And new DNA analysis techniques enable sequencing without the need for expensive equipment or high-tech laboratories. However, any risk evaluations regarding potential harm from genomic data (ab)use have to be performed in the context of existing risks and changing attitudes, e.g. the widespread, willing exposure of private and possibly compromising data through social media platforms. This part of the course will address some of the issues related to the sharing of human genome and associated data, including the \"why\" and some current \"how\" concepts such as the \"Beacon\" protocol and the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) in general; ways to breach genomic privacy and possible mitigations, the (ab?)use of DTC derived data repositories for \"long-range re-identification attacks\" by law enforcement agencies - and set this in perspective with the \"online social\" behaviour of the \"humans of the 2020s\".

Abstract The Progenetix oncogenomics resource provides sample-specific cancer genome profiling data and biomedical annotations as well as provenance data for cancer studies. Especially through more than 100k genomic copy number number (CNV) profiles from over 500 cancer types, Progenetix empowers comparative analyses vastly exceeding individual studies and diagnostic concepts. Progenetix has been used in research studies, clinical diagnostics and in the development of data standards for the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and the European bioinformatics initiative ELIXIR. The Beacon+ service, implemented on top of Progenetix data, has been instrumental in developing and testing features of the Beacon protocol such as structural variant queries, \"handover\" data delivery and the implementation of queries for phenoptypic and diagnostic parameters for the upcoming Beacon v2 protocol. During development of GA4GH metadata concepts and schemas - which influenced standards such as the Phenopackets format - cancer specific annotations from Progenetix have informed conceptual requirements and domain-specific mappings. The resource's focus on structural genome variants has been instrumental in addressing their specific requirements in GA4GH schema development and the Beacon protocol. We demonstrate how an open genomic reference resource has been built around emerging GA4GH standards and how it is being used to support ongoing and future developments in GA4GH and ELIXIR implementation studies, including an introduction about utilizing the Progenetix code repositories for genomics resource development. Highlights from the aggregation of cancer genomic profiling data and the associated annotations will be presented.

While specific CNV events and some recurring patterns have contributed to the identification of individual cancer drivers and the recognition of cancer subtypes, the complexity of genomic CNV patterns requires large amounts of well-defined genomic profiles for statistically meaningful analyses. At the other end of the spectrum, in the area of rare disease genomics the potential pathogenicity of individual CNV events requires validation against a vast set of disease-related and reference genomic profiles and annotations. Methods The \u201cBeacon\u201d protocol - developed with support from ELIXIR, the European bioinformatics infrastructure organization, as a standard of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) - represents an emerging standard for an \u201cInternet for Genomics\u201d. While the initial version of the protocol served as a widely adopted test bed for the sharing of genomic variants over federated query systems connecting hundreds of internationally distributed resources, the version 2 of the protocol aims at providing a framework for extended, metadata-rich query and response options in both public and restricted federated access scenarios. Throughout the development of Beacon v2, the Progenetix cancer genomics resource (progenetix.org) - including the largest publicly accessible set of cancer CNV data - has served as a testbed for implementation of Beacon v2 protocol features. Results With the implementation of the Beacon v2 API as backbone of the Progenetix resource - serving genome-wide CNV profiling data from more than 130\u2019000 individual experiments, representing over 700 diagnostic entities and more that 1\u2019500 published studies - we could demonstrate the use of the GA4GH Beacon v2 protocol as a practical solution for the sharing of vast amounts of genomic profiling data, in a open setting and using a documented, completely open API for third party use. Conclusion: With the Beacon v2 protocol - as a major upgrade from the v1 standard - currently being under review as GA4GH standard, work is focussing on its implementation in a wide set of use cases, from access protected clinical information systems to public-access research databases. Importantly, an ELIXIR-supported implementation study by members of the ELIXIR h-CNV community (cnvar.org) will explore the generation of Beacon v2 powered CNV implementations by various major European genomics resources, in the fields of human genetics / rare diseases and cancer genomics.

Cancer cell lines are necessary tools for understanding the disease mechanisms as well as the development of new cancer treatments. However, they may not always be the best representation of their neoplasm of origin, due to cell line contamination and misidentification, as well as higher numbers of accumulated mutations in the cancer cell line genome.

The main goal of the Progenetix database is to provide easy, open access for research studies and clinical diagnostics. To facilitate sharing of genomic data, Progenetix complies with and contributes to GA4GH and Beacon data standards. Beacon, developed with the support from ELXIR (the European bioinformatics infrastructure organization), started out as protocol to share genomic variants over federated queries. The development of Beacon (Beacon v2) enables extended metadata-rich queries in both public and restricted federated access modes. The implementation of Beacon v2 API in Progenetix offers a solution to sharing vast amounts of genomic data securely and effectively. Moreover, it represents a well-documented, open-access protcol with an open API for third party use. Currently, Progenetix contains around 130'000 cancer copy number variant (CNV) profiles from more than 700 different cancer types (NCIt classification), making it the largest publicly accessible resource for cancer CNV profiles. In addition to primary neoplasia samples, Progenetix also includes CNV profiles from instances of several thousand cancer cell line samples. In order to provide a comprehensive cancer cell line variant database, Progenetix recently started to incorporate annotations about known single nucleotide variants of cancer cell lines, thereby laying the foundation for a comprehensive cancer cell line genomics resource, which will be instrumental in a better assignment of cancer cell lines to alteration-matched diagnostic subtypes of primary neoplasias.","title":"A cancer genomics resource built on GA4GH standards"},{"location":"presentations/2022-07-31-Rahel_CGC/#a-cancer-genomics-resource-built-on-ga4gh-standards","text":"","title":"A cancer genomics resource built on GA4GH standards"},{"location":"presentations/2022-07-31-Rahel_CGC/#rahel-paloots-michael-baudis","text":"","title":"Rahel Paloots, Michael Baudis"},{"location":"publications/%2Bpublications.prepend/","text":"A list of publication can also be retrieved through EuropePMC .","title":"+publications.prepend"},{"location":"publications/2016-01-01-The-SIB-Swiss/","text":"The SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics' resources: focus on curated databases. \u00b6 SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics Members. \u00b6 Abstract The SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics ( www.isb-sib.ch ) provides world-class bioinformatics databases, software tools, services and training to the international life science community in academia and industry.

Nuclear poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) formation is thought to be induced in response to oxidative DNA damage and to promote cell death under sustained oxidative stress conditions. However, what exactly triggers PAR induction in response to oxidative stress is incompletely understood. Using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) and in-depth analysis of key stress signaling components, we observed that PAR formation induced by H2O2 was mediated by the PLC/IP3R/Ca(2+)/PKC\u03b1 signaling axis. Mechanistically, H2O2-induced PAR formation correlated with Ca(2+)-dependent DNA damage, which, however, was PKC\u03b1-independent. In contrast, PAR formation was completely lost upon knockdown of PKC\u03b1, suggesting that DNA damage alone was not sufficient for inducing PAR formation, but required a PKC\u03b1-dependent process. Intriguingly, the loss of PAR formation observed upon PKC\u03b1 depletion was overcome when the chromatin structure-modifying protein HMGB1 was co-depleted with PKC\u03b1, suggesting that activation and nuclear translocation of PKC\u03b1 releases the inhibitory effect of HMGB1 on PAR formation. Together, these results identify PKC\u03b1 and HMGB1 as important co-regulators involved in H2O2-induced PAR formation, a finding that may have important relevance for oxidative stress-associated pathophysiological conditions.

Besides, large derivative log ratio spread (DLRS) of the probes correlating with poor DNA quality is sometimes observed in genome screening experiments and may lead to unreliable copy number profiles. Depending on the extent of these artefacts and the resulting misidentification of copy number alterations/variations (CNA/CNV), it may be desirable to exclude such samples from analyses or to adapt the downstream data analysis strategy accordingly.Here, we propose a method to distinguish reliable genomic copy number profiles from those containing heavy wave artefacts and/or large DLRS. We define four features that adequately summarize the copy number profiles for reliability assessment, and train a classifier on a dataset of 1522 copy number profiles from various microarray platforms. The method can be applied to predict the reliability of copy number profiles irrespective of the underlying microarray platform and may be adapted for those sequencing platforms from which copy number estimates could be computed as a piecewise constant signal. Further details can be found at github.com/baudisgroup/CNARA .We have developed a method for the assessment of genomic copy number profiling data, and suggest to apply the method in addition to and after other state-of-the-art noise correction and quality control procedures.

The conversion of genome coordinates between different assemblies is required for many integrative and comparative studies.

Using in silico DNA copy number analysis, we have demonstrated that ~20% of CC samples exhibit gain of 8q22.3 and 19q13.31; the regions of the genome that encodes the KLF10 and PSG genes, respectively. Gene expression studies demonstrated that there were no alterations in KLF10 mRNA expression, whilst the PSG2 and \u22125 genes were up- regulated by 1.76 and 3.97-fold respectively in CC compared to normal tissue controls. siRNA and ChIP experiments in SiHa cells have demonstrated that KLF10 participates in immune response through regulation of IL6, IL25 and PSG2 and PSG5 genes. Using cervical tissues from KLF10\u2212/\u2212 mice, we have identified down-regulation of PSG17, \u221221 and \u221223 and IL11.

Disentangling the effects related to particular population backgrounds can help in both understanding cancer biology and in tailoring therapeutic interventions. Because self-reported or inferred patient data can be incomplete or misleading due to migration and genomic admixture, a data-driven ancestry estimation should be preferred. While tools to map and utilize ancestry information from healthy individuals have been introduced, a population assignment based on genotyping data from somatic variation profiling of cancer samples is still missing. We analyzed sequencing-based variation data from the 1000 Genomes project, containing 2504 individuals out of 5 continental groups. This reference was then used to extract population-biased SNPs used in genotyping array platforms of varying resolutions. We found that despite widespread and extensive somatic mutations of cancer profiling data, more than 90% of cancer samples can be correctly mapped to one of the population group when compared to their paired unmutated normals. Pre-filtering samples for admixed individuals increased the accuracy to 96%. This work provides a data-driven approach to estimate the population background from cancer genome profiling data. This proof-of-concept study will facilitate efforts to understand the interplay between population and ethnicity related genetic background and differences in understanding statistical and molecular differences in cancer entities with respect to possible hereditary contributions.

For the understanding of malignant clones, precise information about their genomic composition has to be correlated with morphological, clinical and individual features, in the context of the available medical knowledge. Rapid improvements in molecular profiling techniques, the accumulation of large amount of data in genomic alterations in human malignancies and the expansion of bioinformatic tools and methodologies have facilitated the understanding of the molecular changes during oncogenesis, and their correlation with clinico-pathological phenotypes. Far beyond a limited set of \"driver\" genes, oncogenomic profiling has identified a large variety of somatic mutations; and whole genome sequencing studies of healthy individuals have improved the knowledge of heritable genome variation. Nevertheless, main challenges arise from the skewed representation of individuals from varying population backgrounds in biomedical studies, and also through the limited extend in which some cancer entities are represented in the scientific literature.

Disentangling the ef- fects related to particular population backgrounds can help in both understanding cancer biology and in tailoring therapeu- tic interventions. Because self-reported or inferred patient data can be incomplete or misleading due to migration and genomic admixture, a data-driven ancestry estimation should be pre- ferred. While algorithms to analyze ancestry structure from healthy individuals have been developed, an easy-to-use tool to assign population groups based on genotyping data from SNP profiles is still missing and benchmarking for the validity of pop- ulation assignment strategy for aberrant cancer genomes was not tested. We benchmarked the consistency and accuracy of cross- platform population assignment. We also demonstrated its high accuracy to process unaltered as well as cancer genomes. De- spite widespread and extensive somatic mutations of cancer pro- filing data, population assignment consistency between germline and highly mutated samples from cancer patients reached of 97% and 92% for assignment into 5 and 26 populations re- spectively. Comparison of our benchmarked results with self- reported meta-data estimated a matching rate between 88 % to 92%. Despite a relatively high matching rate, the ethnicity labels indicated in meta-data are vague compared to the stan- dardized output from our tool. We have developed a bioinformatics tool to assign the popula- tions from genome profiling data and validated its performance in healthy as well as aberrant cancer genomes. It is ready-to-use for genotyping data from nine commercial SNP array platforms or sequencing data. This tool is effective to scrutinize the popu- lation structure in cancer genomes and provides better measure to integrate genotyping data from various platforms instead of self-reported information. It will facilitate research on inter- play between ethnicity related genetic background and molecu- lar patterns in cancer entities and disentangling possible hered- itary contributions.

DOI 10.1101/720854 \u00b6 Abstract Copy number variations (CNV) are regional deviations from the normal autosomal bi-allelic DNA content. While germline CNVs are a major contributor to genomic syndromes and inherited diseases, the majority of cancers accumulate extensive \u201csomatic\u201d CNV (sCNV or CNA) during the process of oncogenetic transformation and progression. While specific sCNV have closely been associated with tumorigenesis, intriguingly many neoplasias exhibit recurrent sCNV patterns beyond the involvement of a few cancer driver genes. Currently, CNV profiles of tumor samples are generated using genomic micro-arrays or high-throughput DNA sequencing. Regardless of the underlying technology, genomic copy number data is derived from the relative assessment and integration of multiple signals, with the data generation process being prone to contamination from several sources. Estimated copy number values have no absolute and linear correlation to their corresponding DNA levels, and the extent of deviation differs between sample profiles which poses a great challenge for data integration and comparison in large scale genome analysis. In this study, we present a novel method named Minimum Error Calibration and Normalization of Copy Numbers Analysis (Mecan4CNA). For each sCNV profile, Mecan4CNA reduces the noise level, calculates values representing the normal DNA copies (baseline) and the change of one copy (level distance), and finally normalizes all values. Experiments of Mecan4CNA on simulated data showed an overall accuracy of 93% and 91% in determining the baseline and level distance, respectively. Comparison of baseline and level distance estimation with existing methods and karyotyping data on the NCI-60 tumor cell line produced coherent results. To estimate the method\u2019s impact on downstream analyses we performed GISTIC analyses on original and Mecan4CNA data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) where the normalized data showed prominent improvements of both sensitivity and specificity in detecting focal regions. In general, Mecan4CNA provides an advanced method for CNA data normalization especially in research involving data of high volume and heterogeneous quality. but with its informative output and visualization can also facilitate analysis of individual CNA profiles.

Whether specific vulnerabilities to PARPi exist beyond BRCA mutations and related defects in homology-directed repair (HDR) is not well understood. Here, we identify the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIP12 as negative regulator of PARPi sensitivity. We show that TRIP12 controls steady-state PARP1 levels and limits PARPi-induced cytotoxic PARP1 trapping. Upon loss of TRIP12, elevated PARPi-induced PARP1 trapping causes increased DNA replication stress, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell death. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that TRIP12 binds PARP1 via a central PAR-binding WWE domain and, using its carboxy-terminal HECT domain, catalyzes polyubiquitylation of PARP1, triggering proteasomal degradation and preventing supra-physiological PARP1 accumulation. Further, in cohorts of breast and ovarian cancer patients, PARP1 abundance is negatively correlated with TRIP12 expression. We thus propose TRIP12 as regulator of PARP1 stability and PARPi-induced PARP trapping, with potential implications for PARPi sensitivity and resistance.","title":"The Ubiquitin Ligase TRIP12 Limits PARP1 Trapping and Constrains PARP Inhibitor Efficiency"},{"location":"publications/2020-08-04-publication-trip12-parp1-study-CellRep/#the-ubiquitin-ligase-trip12-limits-parp1-trapping-and-constrains-parp-inhibitor-efficiency","text":"","title":"The Ubiquitin Ligase TRIP12 Limits PARP1 Trapping and Constrains PARP Inhibitor Efficiency"},{"location":"publications/2020-10-13-The-ELIXIR-Human-Copy-Number-Variations-Community/","text":"The ELIXIR Human Copy Number Variations Community: building bioinformatics infrastructure for research \u00b6 Salgado D, Armean IM, Baudis M et al. \u00b6 F1000Research 2020, 9 (ELIXIR):1229 \u00b6 Abstract \u00b6 Copy number variations (CNVs) are major causative contributors both in the genesis of genetic diseases and human neoplasias.

Traditionally, malignant diseases have been classified using domain-specific or generalized classification systems, based on histopathological features and clinical gestalt. Aside from the general purpose 'International Classification for Diseases in Oncology' (ICD-O; WHO), hierarchical terminologies such as NCIt promote data interoperability and ontology-driven computational analysis. To evaluate two prominent, general cancer classification systems (NCIt and ICD-O) towards their concordance with genomic mutation patterns we have performed a data-driven meta-analysis of 83'505 curated cancer samples with genome-wide CNA (copy number aberration) profiles from our Progenetix database. The analysis provides a basis to assess the correspondence level of existing classification systems with respect to homogeneous molecular groups, and how individual codes represent an adequately detailed classification.","title":"Copy number variant heterogeneity among cancer types reflects inconsistent concordance with diagnostic classifications"},{"location":"publications/2021-03-01-preprint-Copy-number-variant-heterogeneity/#copy-number-variant-heterogeneity-among-cancer-types-reflects-inconsistent-concordance-with-diagnostic-classifications","text":"","title":"Copy number variant heterogeneity among cancer types reflects inconsistent concordance with diagnostic classifications"},{"location":"publications/2021-04-15-publication-Bo-classifiers/","text":"Signatures of Discriminative Copy Number Aberrations in 31 Cancer Subtypes \u00b6 Bo Gao and Michael Baudis (2021) \u00b6 Published at Frontiers in Genetics , 2021-05-13 \u00b6 Abstract \u00b6 Copy number aberrations (CNA) are one of the most important classes of genomic mutations relatedto oncogenetic effects. In the past three decades, a vast amount of CNA data has been generated bymolecular-cytogenetic and genome sequencing based methods. While this data has been instrumentalin the identification of cancer-related genes and promoted research into the relation between CNA andhisto-pathologically defined cancer types, the heterogeneity of source data and derived CNV profilespose great challenges for data integration and comparative analysis. Furthermore, a majority of exist-ing studies have been focused on the association of CNA to pre-selected \u201ddriver\u201d genes with limitedapplication to rare drivers and other genomic elements. In this study, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline to integrate a collection of 44,988 high-qualityCNA profiles of high diversity. Using a hybrid model of neural networks and attention algorithm, wegenerated the CNA signatures of 31 cancer subtypes, depicting the uniqueness of their respective CNAlandscapes. Finally, we constructed a multi-label classifier to identify the cancer type and the organ oforigin from copy number profiling data. The investigation of the signatures suggested common patterns,not only of physiologically related cancer types but also of clinico-pathologically distant cancer typessuch as different cancers originating from the neural crest. Further experiments of classification modelsconfirmed the effectiveness of the signatures in distinguishing different cancer types and demonstratedtheir potential in tumor classification.

Abstract \u00b6 In cancer, copy number aberrations (CNAs) represent a type of nearly ubiquitous and frequently extensive structural genome variations. To disentangle the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis as well as identify and characterize molecular subtypes, the comparative and meta-analysis of large genomic variant collections can be of immense importance. Over the last decades, cancer genomic profiling projects have resulted in a large amount of somatic genome variation profiles, however segregated in a multitude of individual studies and datasets. The Progenetix project, initiated in 2001, curates individual cancer CNA profiles and associated metadata from published oncogenomic studies and data repositories with the aim to empower integrative analyses spanning all different cancer biologies. During the last few years, the fields of genomics and cancer research have seen significant advancement in terms of molecular genetics technology, disease concepts, data standard harmonization as well as data availability, in an increasingly structured and systematic manner. For the Progenetix resource, continuous data integration, curation and maintenance have resulted in the most comprehensive representation of cancer genome CNA profiling data with 138 663 (including 115 357 tumor) copy number variation (CNV) profiles. In this article, we report a 4.5-fold increase in sample number since 2013, improvements in data quality, ontology representation with a CNV landscape summary over 51 distinctive National Cancer Institute Thesaurus cancer terms as well as updates in database schemas, and data access including new web front-end and programmatic data access.

We present the GA4GH suite of secure, interoperable technical standards and policy frameworks and review the current status of standards, their relevance to key domains of research and clinical care, and future plans of GA4GH. Broad international participation in building, adopting, and deploying GA4GH standards and frameworks will catalyze an unprecedented effort in data sharing that will be critical to advancing genomic medicine and ensuring that all populations can access its benefits.","title":"GA4GH - International policies and standards"},{"location":"publications/2021-11-10-Cell-Genomics-GA4GH-marker-paper/#ga4gh-international-policies-and-standards-for-data-sharing-across-genomic-research-and-healthcare","text":"","title":"GA4GH: International policies and standards for data sharing across genomic research and healthcare"},{"location":"publications/2021-12-01-preprint-phenopackets-v2/","text":"The GA4GH Phenopacket schema: A computable representation of clinical data for precision medicine \u00b6 Jacobsen JOB, Baudis M, Baynam GS, Beckmann JS, Beltran S, Callahan TJ, Chute CG, Courtot M, Danis D, Elemento O, Freimuth RR, Gargano MA, Groza T, Hamosh A, Harris NL, Kaliyaperumal R, Khalifa A, Krawitz PM, Koehler S, Laraway BJ, Lehvaeslaiho H, Lloyd KC, Matalonga L, McMurry JA, Metke-Jimenez A, Mungall CJ, Munoz-Torres MC, Ogishima S, Papakonstantinou A, Piscia D, Pontikos N, Queralt-Rosinach N, Roos M, Schofield PN, Siapos A, Smedley D, Smith LD, Steinhaus R, Sundaramurthi JC, Swietlik EM, Thun S, Vasilevsky NA, Wagner AH, Warner JL, Weiland C, Haendel MA, Robinson PN. \u00b6 medRxiv, 2021.11.27.21266944. doi:10.1101/2021.11.27.21266944 \u00b6 Abstract \u00b6 Despite great strides in the development and wide acceptance of standards for exchanging structured information about genomic variants, there is no corresponding standard for exchanging phenotypic data, and this has impeded the sharing of phenotypic information for computational analysis.

The popularity of this concept has fostered the design of a version 2, that better serves real-world requirements and addresses the needs of clinical genomics research and healthcare, as assessed by several contributing projects and organizations. Particularly, rare disease genetics and cancer research will benefit from new case level and genomic variant level requests and the enabling of richer phenotype and clinical queries as well as support for fuzzy searches. Beacon is designed as a \"lingua franca\" to bridge data collections hosted in software solutions with different and rich interfaces. Beacon version 2 works alongside popular standards like Phenopackets, OMOP, or FHIR, allowing implementing consortia to return matches in beacon responses and provide a handover to their preferred data exchange format.

Phenotypic features (signs, symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, results of physiological tests, etc.) are of high clinical importance, yet exchanging them in conjunction with genomic variation information is often overlooked or even neglected. In the clinical domain, substantial work has been dedicated to the development of computational phenotypes. Traditionally, these approaches have largely relied on rule-based methods and large sources of clinical data to identify cohorts of patients with or without a specific disease. However, they were not developed to enable deep phenotyping of abnormalities, to facilitate computational analysis of interpatient phenotypic similarity or to support computational decision support. To address this, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health6 (GA4GH) has developed the Phenopacket schema, which supports the exchange of computable longitudinal case-level phenotypic information for diagnosis of, and research on, all types of disease, including Mendelian and complex genetic diseases, cancers and infectious diseases. A Phenopacket characterizes an individual person or biosample, linking that individual to detailed phenotypic descriptions, genetic information, diagnoses and treatments.

While the impact of many point mutations can be evaluated through their modification of individual genomic elements, even single copy number aberrations (CNAs) may encompass hundreds of genes and therefore pose challenges to untangle potentially complex functional effects. However, consistent, recurring and disease-specific patterns in the genome-wide CNA landscape imply that particular CNA may promote cancer type-specific characteristics. Discerning essential cancer-promoting alterations from the inherent co-dependency in CNA would improve the understanding of mechanisms of CNA and provide new insights into cancer biology and potential therapeutic targets. Here we implement a model using segment breakpoints to discover non-random gene coverage by copy number deletion (CND). With a diverse set of cancer types from multiple resources, this model identified common and cancer type-specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes as well as cancer-promoting functional pathways. Confirmed by differential expression analysis of data from corresponding cancer types, the results show that for most cancer types, despite dissimilarity of their CND landscapes, similar canonical pathways are affected. In 25 analyses of 17 cancer types, we have identified 20-170 significant genes by copy deletion, including RB1, PTEN and CDKN2A as the most significantly deleted genes among all cancer types. We have also shown a shared dependence on core pathways for cancer progression in different cancers as well as cancer-type separation by genome-wide significance scores. While this work provides a reference for gene specific significance in many cancers, it chiefly contributes a general framework to derive genome-wide significance and molecular insights in CND profiles with a potential for the analysis of rare cancer types as well as non-coding regions.","title":"Candidate targets of copy number deletion events across 17 cancer types"},{"location":"publications/2022-07-01-preprint-breakpoint-statistics/#candidate-targets-of-copy-number-deletion-events-across-17-cancer-types","text":"","title":"Candidate targets of copy number deletion events across 17 cancer types"},{"location":"publications/1995-2000/1995-12-01-Identification-of/","text":"Identification of genetic imbalances in malignant lymphoma using comparative genomic hybridization. \u00b6 Bentz M, D\u00f6hner H, Werner CA, Huck K, Baudis M, Joos S, Schlegelberger B, Tr\u00fcmper LH, Feller AC, Pfreundschuh M. \u00b6 Abstract In comparison to leukemias, the clinical relevance of chromosomal aberrations in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is not as well understood. This is primarily due to limitations of chromosomal banding techniques which have been the central methods for cytogenetic analysis. These techniques depend on the availability of fresh tumor tissue and the examination of metaphase cells which may not be representative for the major cell clone in vivo. In contrast, the new technique of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) allows researchers to obtain a comprehensive view of chromosomal gains and losses by analyzing tumor DNA, which can be prepared from archival tissue samples. Results of CGH studies in three different types of lymphoproliferative disorders are outlined in this paper demonstrating that: (1) in chronic B cell leukemias, chromosomal aberrations are missed by banding analysis in a high proportion of cases, (2) CGH on paraffin-embedded tissue samples can be used for cytogenetic analysis within clinical multicenter trials and (3) DNA amplifications are more frequent in NHL than previously assumed. Thus, it can be expected that CGH will contribute both to the understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms and the identification of clinically relevant chromosome aberrations in NHL.","title":"Identification of..."},{"location":"publications/1995-2000/1995-12-01-Identification-of/#identification-of-genetic-imbalances-in-malignant-lymphoma-using-comparative-genomic-hybridization","text":"","title":"Identification of genetic imbalances in malignant lymphoma using comparative genomic hybridization."},{"location":"publications/1995-2000/1996-01-01-Chromosome/","text":"Chromosome imbalances in papillary renal cell carcinoma and first cytogenetic data of familial cases analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization. \u00b6 Bentz M, Bergerheim US, Li C, Joos S, Werner CA, Baudis M, Gnarra J, Merino MJ, Zbar B, Linehan WM, Lichter P. \u00b6 Abstract We used comparative genomic hybridization to analyze 17 tumor samples from 11 patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC), including three patients with hereditary papillary RCC.

Regions most frequently amplified were bands Xq26-28, 2p23-24, and 2p14-16 as well as 18q21 (three times each). Amplification of several proto-oncogenes and a cell cycle control gene (N-MYC (two cases), BCL2, CCND2, and GLI) located within the amplified regions was demonstrated by Southern blot analysis or fluorescence in situ hybridization to interphase nuclei of tumor cells. These data demonstrate that gene amplifications in B-cell neoplasms are much more frequent than previously assumed. The identification of highly amplified DNA regions and genes included in the amplicons provides important information for further analyses of genetic events involved in lymphomagenesis.","title":"High-level DNA..."},{"location":"publications/1995-2000/1997-08-01-High-level-DNA/#high-level-dna-amplifications-are-common-genetic-aberrations-in-b-cell-neoplasms","text":"","title":"High-level DNA amplifications are common genetic aberrations in B-cell neoplasms."},{"location":"publications/1995-2000/1997-12-01-Analysis-of-genomic/","text":"Analysis of genomic alterations in benign, atypical, and anaplastic meningiomas: toward a genetic model of meningioma progression. \u00b6 Weber RG, Bostr\u00f6m J, Wolter M, Baudis M, Collins VP, Reifenberger G, Lichter P. \u00b6 Abstract Nineteen benign [World Health Organization (WHO) grade I; MI], 21 atypical (WHO grade II; MII), and 19 anaplastic (WHO grade III; MIII) sporadic meningiomas were screened for chromosomal imbalances by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). These data were supplemented by molecular genetic analyses of selected chromosomal regions and genes. With increasing malignancy grade, a marked accumulation of genomic aberrations was observed; i.e., the numbers (mean +/- SEM) of total alterations detected per tumor were 2.9 +/- 0.7 for MI, 9.2 +/- 1.2 for MII, and 13.3 +/- 1.9 for MIII. The most frequent alteration detected in MI was loss on 22q (58%). In MII, aberrations most commonly identified were losses on 1p (76%), 22q (71%), 14q (43%), 18q (43%), 10 (38%), and 6q (33%), as well as gains on 20q (48%), 12q (43%), 15q (43%), 1q (33%), 9q (33%), and 17q (33%). In MIII, most of these alterations were found at similar frequencies. However, an increase in losses on 6q (53%), 10 (68%), and 14q (63%) was observed. In addition, 32% of MIII demonstrated loss on 9p. Homozygous deletions in the CDKN2A gene at 9p21 were found in 4 of 16 MIII (25%). Highly amplified DNA sequences were mapped to 12q13-q15 by CGH in 1 MII. Southern blot analysis of this tumor revealed amplification of CDK4 and MDM2. By CGH, DNA sequences from 17q were found to be amplified in 1 MII and 8 MIII, involving 17q23 in all cases. Despite the high frequency of chromosomal aberrations in the MII and MIII investigated, none of these tumors showed mutations in exons 5-8 of the TP53 gene. On the basis of the most common aberrations identified in the various malignancy grades, a model for the genomic alterations associated with meningioma progression is proposed.","title":"Analysis of genomic..."},{"location":"publications/1995-2000/1997-12-01-Analysis-of-genomic/#analysis-of-genomic-alterations-in-benign-atypical-and-anaplastic-meningiomas-toward-a-genetic-model-of-meningioma-progression","text":"","title":"Analysis of genomic alterations in benign, atypical, and anaplastic meningiomas: toward a genetic model of meningioma progression."},{"location":"publications/1995-2000/2000-03-01-t-11-14-positive/","text":"t(11;14)-positive mantle cell lymphomas exhibit complex karyotypes and share similarities with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. \u00b6 Bentz M, Plesch A, Bullinger L, Stilgenbauer S, Ott G, M\u00fcller-Hermelink HK, Baudis M, Barth TF, M\u00f6ller P, Lichter P, D\u00f6hner H. \u00b6 Abstract Until now, few data on additional chromosomal aberrations in t(11;14)-positive mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs) have been published.

In 26% of cases (7 of 27) analyzed by CGH, a total of 10 high-level DNA amplifications were identified. Although in comparison with B-cell chronic lymphopcytic leukemia (B-CLL) MCL is characterized by a much higher complexity of chromosomal aberrations, there are striking similarities: 13q14 deletions were identified in more than 50% of both MCL and B-CLL cases. In contrast, in our CGH database containing 293 B-cell lymphomas, this aberration was found in only 11% of other nodal lymphomas.

Apart from sequencing the human genome, there was also a huge increase of knowledge regarding genomic aberrations in cancer. In Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas (NHL), some of these findings already are of clinical relevance; specific genomic aberrations are characteristic of distinct subtypes of NHL and correlate with certain morphological, immunological and clinical findings. In addition, some aberrations are useful as clonal markers for the detection of (minimal) residual disease. However, due to limited availability of fresh lymphoma tumor tissues, there are only scarce data regarding the prognostic significance of specific genomic aberrations in lymphomas. In all these studies, chromosomal banding analyses were performed retrospectively in heterogeneous groups of patients. In contrast to such banding analyses, molecular cytogenetic techniques, such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) do not depend on the availability of fresh tumor samples. Therefore, these methods allow a retrospective genomic screening of archival tissue samples derived from homogeneous groups of patients treated within the same clinical trial.","title":"Potential of..."},{"location":"publications/2001-2007/2001-01-01-Potential-of/#potential-of-chromosomal-and-matrix-based-comparative-genomic-hybridization-for-molecular-diagnostics-in-lymphomas","text":"","title":"Potential of chromosomal and matrix-based comparative genomic hybridization for molecular diagnostics in lymphomas."},{"location":"publications/2001-2007/2001-04-01-Gain-of-chromosome/","text":"Gain of chromosome arm 9p is characteristic of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (MBL): comprehensive molecular cytogenetic analysis and presentation of a novel MBL cell line. \u00b6 Bentz M, Barth TF, Br\u00fcderlein S, Bock D, Schwerer MJ, Baudis M, Joos S, Viardot A, Feller AC, M\u00fcller-Hermelink HK, Lichter P, D\u00f6hner H, M\u00f6ller P. \u00b6 Abstract Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (MBL) is an aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, which has been recognized as a distinct disease entity.

However, given its limited spatial resolution, chromosomal CGH has offered only general information regarding the possible genetic targets of DNA copy number changes. METHODS: In order to further define specific DNA copy number changes in cervical cancer, we analyzed 20 cervical samples (3 pre-malignant lesions, 10 invasive tumors, and 7 cell lines), using the GenoSensor microarray CGH system to define particular genetic targets that suffer copy number changes. RESULTS: The most common DNA gains detected by array CGH in the invasive samples were located at the RBP1-RBP2 (3q21-q22) genes, the sub-telomeric clone C84C11/T3 (5ptel), D5S23 (5p15.2) and the DAB2 gene (5p13) in 58.8% of the samples.

In this study, we aimed for comprehensive genetic subgroup discovery and assessment of independent prognostic markers based on genome-wide aberrations detected by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published CGH data from 231 primary untreated neuroblastomas were converted to a digitized format suitable for global data mining, subgroup discovery, and multivariate survival analyses. RESULTS: In contrast to previous reports, which included only a few genetic parameters, we present here for the first time a strategy that allows unbiased evaluation of all genetic imbalances detected by CGH. The presented approach firmly established the existence of three different clinicogenetic subgroups and indicated that chromosome 17 status and tumor stage were the only independent significant predictors for patient outcome. Important new findings were: (1) a normal chromosome 17 status as a delineator of a subgroup of presumed favorable-stage tumors with highly increased risk; (2) the recognition of a survivor signature conferring 100% 5-year survival for stage 1, 2, and 4S tumors presenting with whole chromosome 17 gain; and (3) the identification of 3p deletion as a hallmark of older age at diagnosis.

It has been thought that multiple mechanisms lead to the malignant phenotype, with familial predisposition syndromes accounting for only a small proportion of all CRC cases. To identify additional loci likely involved in CRC and to test the hypothesis of allele-specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the localization of CRC susceptibility genes, we initially conducted a genome-wide allelotyping analysis of 48 adenomas from a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP) and 63 adenomas from 7 patients with sporadic CRC using 79 fluorescently tagged oligonucleotide primers amplifying microsatellite loci covering the human genome.

The goal is to develop a systematic way of placing patients with similar CGH imbalance profiles into the same cluster. Our expectation is that patients with the same cancer types will generally belong to the same cluster as their underlying CGH profiles will be similar. RESULTS: We focus on distance-based clustering strategies. We do this in two steps. (1) Distances of all pairs of CGH samples are computed. (2) CGH samples are clustered based on this distance. We develop three pairwise distance/similarity measures, namely raw, cosine and sim. Raw measure disregards correlation between contiguous genomic intervals. It compares the aberrations in each genomic interval separately. The remaining measures assume that consecutive genomic intervals may be correlated. Cosine maps pairs of CGH samples into vectors in a high-dimensional space and measures the angle between them. Sim measures the number of independent common aberrations. We test our distance/similarity measures on three well known clustering algorithms, bottom-up, top-down and k-means with and without centroid shrinking. Our results show that sim consistently performs better than the remaining measures. This indicates that the correlation of neighboring genomic intervals should be considered in the structural analysis of CGH datasets. The combination of sim with top-down clustering emerged as the best approach. AVAILABILITY: All software developed in this article and all the datasets are available from the authors upon request.

PROCEDURE: We used representational difference analysis to identify candidate E2A-HLF target genes. Transient transfection assays and an inducible expression model system were then used to evaluate the ability of E2A-HLF to modulate target gene expression. RESULTS: We identified ABCB1 (MDR1, P-glycoprotein) as a gene differentially expressed in ALL cell lines with and without E2A-HLF expression and demonstrated that t(17;19)+ ALL cell lines expressed high levels of ABCB1 protein and had a drug efflux-positive phenotype. Although ABCB1 transcription is regulated by C/EBPbeta via interaction with a DNA response element that shares significant homology with the optimal E2A-HLF binding site, E2A-HLF did not directly activate transcription of reporter genes under control of ABCB1 promoter elements in transient transfection assays. However, ABCB1 expression was induced in a DNA-binding independent manner by E2A-HLF, E2A-PBX1, and truncated E2A polypeptides consisting of those portions of E2A present in leukemic fusion proteins. CONCLUSIONS: E2A-HLF-mediated over-expression of ABCB1 may play a critical role in defining the clinical phenotype of ALLs with a t(17;19), suggesting pharmacologic modulation of ABCB1 activity as a rational therapeutic strategy for this chemotherapy resistant subtype of ALL.","title":"ABCB1 over-expressio..."},{"location":"publications/2001-2007/2006-11-01-ABCB1-over-expressio/#abcb1-over-expression-and-drug-efflux-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-cell-lines-with-t1719-and-e2a-hlf-expression","text":"","title":"ABCB1 over-expression and drug-efflux in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines with t(17;19) and E2A-HLF expression."},{"location":"publications/2001-2007/2007-01-01-Genomic-imbalances/","text":"Genomic imbalances in 5918 malignant epithelial tumors: an explorative meta-analysis of chromosomal CGH data. \u00b6 Baudis M. \u00b6 Abstract BACKGROUND: Chromosomal abnormalities have been associated with most human malignancies, with gains and losses on some genomic regions associated with particular entities. METHODS: Of the 15429 cases collected for the Progenetix molecular-cytogenetic database, 5918 malignant epithelial neoplasias analyzed by chromosomal Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) were selected for further evaluation. For the 22 clinico-pathological entities with more than 50 cases, summary profiles for genomic imbalances were generated from case specific data and analyzed. RESULTS: With large variation in overall genomic instability, recurring genomic gains and losses were prominent. Most entities showed frequent gains involving 8q2, while gains on 20q, 1q, 3q, 5p, 7q and 17q were frequent in different entities. Loss \"hot spots\" included 3p, 4q, 13q, 17p and 18q among others. Related average imbalance patterns were found for clinically distinct entities, e.g. hepatocellular carcinomas (ca.) and ductal breast ca., as well as for histologically related entities (squamous cell ca. of different sites). CONCLUSION: Although considerable case-by-case variation of genomic profiles can be found by CGH in epithelial malignancies, a limited set of variously combined chromosomal imbalances may be typical for carcinogenesis. Focus on the respective regions should aid in target gene detection and pathway deduction.","title":"Genomic imbalances in 5918 malignant tumors"},{"location":"publications/2001-2007/2007-01-01-Genomic-imbalances/#genomic-imbalances-in-5918-malignant-epithelial-tumors-an-explorative-meta-analysis-of-chromosomal-cgh-data","text":"","title":"Genomic imbalances in 5918 malignant epithelial tumors: an explorative meta-analysis of chromosomal CGH data."},{"location":"publications/2001-2007/2007-10-01-Combined-single/","text":"Combined single nucleotide polymorphism-based genomic mapping and global gene expression profiling identifies novel chromosomal imbalances, mechanisms and candidate genes important in the pathogenesis of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia with inv(14)(q11q32). \u00b6 D\u00fcrig J, Bug S, Klein-Hitpass L, Boes T, J\u00f6ns T, Martin-Subero JI, Harder L, Baudis M, D\u00fchrsen U, Siebert R. \u00b6 Abstract T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a rare aggressive lymphoma derived from mature T cells, which is, in most cases, characterized by the presence of an inv(14)(q11q32)/t(14;14)(q11;q32) and a characteristic pattern of secondary chromosomal aberrations. DNA microarray technology was employed to compare the transcriptomes of eight immunomagnetically purified CD3+ normal donor-derived peripheral blood cell samples, with five highly purified inv(14)/t(14;14)-positive T-PLL blood samples. Between the two experimental groups, 734 genes were identified as differentially expressed, including functionally important genes involved in lymphomagenesis, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and DNA repair. Notably, the differentially expressed genes were found to be significantly enriched in genomic regions affected by recurrent chromosomal imbalances.

We screened 61 gangliogliomas [World Health Organization (WHO) grade I] for genomic alterations by chromosomal and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Aberrations were detected in 66% of gangliogliomas (mean +/- SEM = 2.5 +/- 0.5 alterations/tumor).

Recurrent partial imbalances comprised the minimal overlapping regions dim(10)(q25) and enh(12)(q13.3-q14.1). Unsupervised cluster analysis of genomic profiles detected two major subgroups (group I: complete gain of 7 and additional gains of 5, 8 or 12; group II: no major recurring imbalances, mainly losses). A comparison with low-grade gliomas (astrocytomas WHO grade II) showed chromosome 5 gain to be significantly more frequent in gangliogliomas. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) identified the aberrations to be contained in a subpopulation of glial but not in neuronal cells. Two gangliogliomas and their anaplastic recurrences (WHO grade III) were analyzed. Losses of CDKN2A/B and DMBT1 or a gain/amplification of CDK4 found in the anaplastic tumors were already present in the respective gangliogliomas by array CGH and interphase FISH.

This study investigates chromosomal changes that predict the clinical outcome of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and correlate to characteristic clinicopathological parameters. We applied comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to tissue samples from 117 HNSCC patients scheduled for radiotherapy. Genomic aberrations occurring in more than five patients were studied for impact on locoregional progression (LRP)-free survival. p values were adjusted by the Hochberg-Benjamini procedure and significant aberrations and clinical variables subjected to a stepwise backwards Cox proportional model. Significant alterations were further analyzed by array-CGH and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In multivariate survival analysis gains on 1q and 16q predict reduced LRP-free survival independently from known prognostic factors. Cluster analysis separated the HNSCC cases into two groups (cluster 1 and 2) that are characterized by significant differences for imbalances in 13 chromosomal regions. Moreover, it became apparent that cluster 1 correlates to nonanemic patients, while cluster 2 represents predominantly anemic cases. Array-CGH pinpoints 16q24.3 to be the region of interest on chromosome 16 which was further verified by FISH analysis where an increased copy number of FANCA, a member of the Fanconi anemia/breast cancer pathway, could be identified.

However, diagnostic dilemmas may arise in daily practice due to overlap of BL with subsets of other aggressive, mature B-cell lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Recently, two gene expression studies have described a distinct molecular profile for BL, but also showed the persistence of some cases intermediate between BL and DLBCL. An alternative approach to define BL is to consider (cyto)genetic data, in particular chromosomal abnormalities other than the t(8;14) or its variants. In this review the 'Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer,' harboring the majority of all published neoplasia-related karyotypes, was explored to define a cytogenetic profile of 'true' BL. This core subset of BL showed a very low complexity of chromosomal abnormalities with 40% of the cases having the IG-MYC fusion as the sole abnormality. In the remaining cases, additional recurrent but partially exclusive abnormalities included gains at chromosomes 1q, 7 and 12, and losses of 6q, 13q32-34 and 17p. Within the core subset, no differences were found between pediatric and adult patients. In addition, the genetic profile of the core subset was significantly different from BL with an 8q24 breakpoint not affecting one of the three immunoglobulin loci, BL with a translocation involving 18q21/BCL2, 3q27/BCL6 or 11q13/BCL1, additionally to a breakpoint at 8q24/MYC, and from other morphological types of lymphomas with an 8q24/MYC breakpoint. These groups showed a higher cytogenetic complexity than the core subset of BL. BL without a detectable 8q24/MYC breakpoint might be heterogeneous and deserves further studies. We suggest that, concordant with the WHO classification to be published in 2008, the diagnosis of BL should be restricted to cases with expression of CD10 and BCL6, absence or very weak expression of BCL2 protein, a homogeneously very high proliferation index and a proven IG-MYC translocation without evidence of a chromosomal translocation typical for other lymphoma entities. In addition, a high number of nonspecific cytogenetic abnormalities should suggest need for a critical review of the diagnosis of BL.","title":"Translocations..."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2009-02-01-Translocations/#translocations-involving-8q24-in-burkitt-lymphoma-and-other-malignant-lymphomas-a-historical-review-of-cytogenetics-in-the-light-of-todays-knowledge","text":"","title":"Translocations involving 8q24 in Burkitt lymphoma and other malignant lymphomas: a historical review of cytogenetics in the light of todays knowledge."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2009-07-01-Recurrent-loss%2C-but/","text":"Recurrent loss, but lack of mutations, of the SMARCB1 tumor suppressor gene in T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia with TCL1A-TCRAD juxtaposition. \u00b6 Bug S, D\u00fcrig J, Oyen F, Klein-Hitpass L, Martin-Subero JI, Harder L, Baudis M, Arnold N, Kordes U, D\u00fchrsen U, Schneppenheim R, Siebert R. \u00b6 Abstract In T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), chromosomal imbalances affecting the long arm of chromosome 22 are regarded as typical chromosomal aberrations secondary to a TCRAD-TCL1A fusion due to inv(14) or t(14;14).

Understanding the relationship between CNAs and different cancer types is a fundamental problem in cancer studies. RESULTS: This article develops an efficient method that can accurately model the progression of the cancer markers and reconstruct evolutionary relationship between multiple types of cancers using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data. Such modeling can lead to better understanding of the commonalities and differences between multiple cancer types and potential therapies. We have developed an automatic method to infer a graph model for the markers of multiple cancers from a large population of CGH data. Our method identifies highly related markers across different cancer types. It then builds a directed acyclic graph that shows the evolutionary history of these markers based on how common each marker is in different cancer types. We demonstrated the use of this model in determining the importance of markers in cancer evolution. We have also developed a new method to measure the evolutionary distance between different cancers based on their markers. This method employs the graph model we developed for the individual markers to measure the distance between pairs of cancers. We used this measure to create an evolutionary tree for multiple cancers. Our experiments on Progenetix database show that our markers are largely consistent to the reported hot-spot imbalances and most frequent imbalances. The results show that our distance measure can accurately reconstruct the evolutionary relationship between multiple cancer types.","title":"Inferring progressio..."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2009-09-01-Inferring-progressio/#inferring-progression-models-for-cgh-data","text":"","title":"Inferring progression models for CGH data."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2009-11-01-Quantifying-cancer/","text":"Quantifying cancer progression with conjunctive Bayesian networks. \u00b6 Gerstung M, Baudis M, Moch H, Beerenwinkel N. \u00b6 Abstract MOTIVATION: Cancer is an evolutionary process characterized by accumulating mutations.

RESULTS: We present a specific probabilistic graphical model for the accumulation of mutations and their interdependencies. The Bayesian network models cancer progression by an explicit unobservable accumulation process in time that is separated from the observable but error-prone detection of mutations. Model parameters are estimated by an Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the underlying interaction graph is obtained by a simulated annealing procedure. Applying this method to cytogenetic data for different cancer types, we find multiple complex oncogenetic pathways deviating substantially from simplified models, such as linear pathways or trees.

Recently, it has been suggested that the facial gestalt of DS has been linked to the distal part of the DSCR whereas the proximal region harboring DSCR1/RCAN and DSCAM should be associated with the cardiac abnormalities. Here, we report on a patient with Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) and a paternally inherited 0.46 Mb duplication in 21q22 affecting the KCNE1 and DSCR1/RCAN genes. The identification of an involvement of KCNE1 was interesting because it encodes the beta-subunit of the KvLQT1 channel as the slow component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K(+) current. Since duplication of the KCNQ1 gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the same channel was reported recently in another SRS patient, we screened both genes for mutations in a cohort of SRS patients without detecting pathologic variants. We presume that the duplication of the two functionally linked genes in different patients with the same disorder is a coincidental finding. However, the lack of DS typical clinical features in our case allows us to further narrow down the DSCR in 21q22. We conclude that DSCR1/RCAN is not sufficient for generating phenotypic features associated with DS but our observation does not contradict a possible role for DSCR1/RCAN in mediating DYRK1A-based effects.","title":"Identification of a..."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2010-02-01-Identification-of-a/#identification-of-a-21q22-duplication-in-a-silver-russell-syndrome-patient-further-narrows-down-the-down-syndrome-critical-region","text":"","title":"Identification of a 21q22 duplication in a Silver-Russell syndrome patient further narrows down the Down syndrome critical region."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2010-05-01-Submicroscopic/","text":"Submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances in idiopathic Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS): the SRS phenotype overlaps with the 12q14 microdeletion syndrome. \u00b6 Spengler S, Sch\u00f6nherr N, Binder G, Wollmann HA, Fricke-Otto S, M\u00fchlenberg R, Denecke B, Baudis M, Eggermann T. \u00b6 Abstract Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is a heterogeneous disorder associated with intrauterine and postnatal growth restriction, body asymmetry, a relative macrocephaly, a characteristic triangular face and further dysmorphisms. In about 50% of patients, genetic/epigenetic alterations can be detected: >38% of patients show a hypomethylation of the IGF2/H19 imprinting region in 11p15, whereas the additional 10% carry a maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7. In single cases, cytogenetic aberrations can be detected. Nevertheless, there still remain 50% of SRS patients without known genetic/epigenetic alterations. To find out whether submicroscopic imbalances contribute to the aetiology of SRS, 20 idiopathic SRS patients were screened with the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500 K array set. Apart from known apathogenic copy number variations, we identified one patient with a 12q14 microdeletion. The 12q14 microdeletion syndrome is characterised by dwarfism but it additionally includes mental retardation and osteopoikilosis. The deletion in our patient is smaller than those in the 12q14 microdeletion carriers but it also affects the LEMD3 and the HMGA2 genes. LEMD3 haploinsufficiency and point mutations have been previously associated with osteopoikilosis but radiographs of our patient at the age of 16 years did not reveal any hint for osteopoikilosis lesions. Haploinsufficiency of HMGA2 is probably responsible for aberrant growth in 12q14 microdeletion syndrome. However, in this study, a general role of HMGA2 mutations for SRS was excluded by sequencing of 20 idiopathic patients. In conclusion, our results exclude a common cryptic chromosomal imbalance in idiopathic SRS patients but show that chromosomal aberrations are relevant in this disease.

By means of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical methods, 83 breast tissue samples were analyzed for MUC1 gene amplification and protein expression. This analysis showed MUC1 genomic amplification and a positive association with the histopathological group in 12% (1 out of 8) of benign lesions and 38% (23 out of 60) of primary invasive breast carcinoma samples (P = 0.004). Array-comparative genomic hybridization meta-analysis of 886 primary invasive breast carcinomas obtained from 22 studies showed MUC1 genomic gain in 43.7% (387 out of 886) of the samples. Moreover, we identified a highly statistical significant association between MUC1 gene amplification and MUC1 protein expression assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot test (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that MUC1 copy number increases from normal breast tissue to primary invasive breast carcinomas in correlation with MUC1 protein expression.","title":"MUC1 oncogene..."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2010-09-01-MUC1-oncogene/#muc1-oncogene-amplification-correlates-with-protein-overexpression-in-invasive-breast-carcinoma-cells","text":"","title":"MUC1 oncogene amplification correlates with protein overexpression in invasive breast carcinoma cells."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2011-01-01-CDCOCA-a-statistica/","text":"CDCOCA: a statistical method to define complexity dependence of co-occuring chromosomal aberrations. \u00b6 Kumar N, Rehrauer H, Cai H, Baudis M. \u00b6 Abstract BACKGROUND: Copy number alterations (CNA) play a key role in cancer development and progression. Since more than one CNA can be detected in most tumors, frequently co-occurring genetic CNA may point to cooperating cancer related genes. Existing methods for co-occurrence evaluation so far have not considered the overall heterogeneity of CNA per tumor, resulting in a preferential detection of frequent changes with limited specificity for each association due to the high genetic instability of many samples. METHOD: We hypothesize that in cancer some linkage-independent CNA may display a non-random co-occurrence, and that these CNA could be of pathogenetic relevance for the respective cancer. We also hypothesize that the statistical relevance of co-occurring CNA may depend on the sample specific CNA complexity. We verify our hypotheses with a simulation based algorithm CDCOCA (complexity dependence of co-occurring chromosomal aberrations). RESULTS: Application of CDCOCA to example data sets identified co-occurring CNA from low complex background which otherwise went unnoticed. Identification of cancer associated genes in these co-occurring changes can provide insights of cooperative genes involved in oncogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a method to detect associations of regional copy number abnormalities in cancer data. Along with finding statistically relevant CNA co-occurrences, our algorithm points towards a generally low specificity for co-occurrence of regional imbalances in CNA rich samples, which may have negative impact on pathway modeling approaches relying on frequent CNA events.","title":"CDCOCA: a statistica..."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2011-01-01-CDCOCA-a-statistica/#cdcoca-a-statistical-method-to-define-complexity-dependence-of-co-occuring-chromosomal-aberrations","text":"","title":"CDCOCA: a statistical method to define complexity dependence of co-occuring chromosomal aberrations."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2011-07-01-Silver-Russell/","text":"Silver-Russell patients showing a broad range of ICR1 and ICR2 hypomethylation in different tissues. \u00b6 Begemann M, Spengler S, Kanber D, Haake A, Baudis M, Leisten I, Binder G, Markus S, Rupprecht T, Segerer H, Fricke-Otto S, M\u00fchlenberg R, Siebert R, Buiting K, Eggermann T. \u00b6 Abstract In all known congenital imprinting disorders an association with aberrant methylation or mutations at specific loci was well established. However, several patients with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM), Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) exhibiting multilocus hypomethylation (MLH) have meanwhile been described. Whereas TNDM patients with MLH show clinical symptoms different from carriers with isolated 6q24 aberrations, MLH carriers diagnosed as BWS or SRS present only the syndrome-specific features. Interestingly, SRS and BWS patients with nearly identical MLH patterns in leukocytes have been identified. We now report on the molecular findings in DNA in three SRS patients with hypomethylation of both 11p15 imprinted control regions (ICRs) in leukocytes. One patient was a monozygotic (MZ) twin, another was a triplet. While the hypomethylation affected both oppositely imprinted 11p15 ICRs in leukocytes, in buccal swab DNA only the ICR1 hypomethylation was visible in two of our patients. In the non-affected MZ twin of one of these patients, aberrant methylation was also present in leukocytes but neither in buccal swab DNA nor in skin fibroblasts. Despite mutation screening of several factors involved in establishment and maintenance of methylation marks including ZFP57, MBD3, DNMT1 and DNMT3L the molecular clue for the ICR1/ICR2 hypomethylation in our patients remained unclear. Furthermore, the reason for the development of the specific SRS phenotype is not obvious.

Recent approaches to molecularly classify RCC were based on clinical, pathological as well as on single molecular parameters. As a consequence, gene expression patterns reflecting the sum of genetic aberrations in individual tumors may not have been recognized. In an attempt to uncover such molecular features in RCC, we used a novel, unbiased and integrative approach. METHODS: We integrated gene expression data from 97 primary RCC of different pathologic parameters, 15 RCC metastases as well as 34 cancer cell lines for two-way nonsupervised hierarchical clustering using gene groups suggested by the PANTHER Classification System. We depicted the genomic landscape of the resulted tumor groups by means of Single Nuclear Polymorphism (SNP) technology. Finally, the achieved results were immunohistochemically analyzed using a tissue microarray (TMA) composed of 254 RCC. RESULTS: We found robust, genome wide expression signatures, which split RCC into three distinct molecular subgroups. These groups remained stable even if randomly selected gene sets were clustered. Notably, the pattern obtained from RCC cell lines was clearly distinguishable from that of primary tumors. SNP array analysis demonstrated differing frequencies of chromosomal copy number alterations among RCC subgroups. TMA analysis with group-specific markers showed a prognostic significance of the different groups. CONCLUSION: We propose the existence of characteristic and histologically independent genome-wide expression outputs in RCC with potential biological and clinical relevance.","title":"Integrative..."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2012-01-01-Integrative/#integrative-genome-wide-expression-profiling-identifies-three-distinct-molecular-subgroups-of-renal-cell-carcinoma-with-different-patient-outcome","text":"","title":"Integrative genome-wide expression profiling identifies three distinct molecular subgroups of renal cell carcinoma with different patient outcome."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2012-01-01-Losses-at-chromosome/","text":"Losses at chromosome 4q are associated with poor survival in operable ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma. \u00b6 Luebke AM, Baudis M, Matthaei H, Vashist YK, Verde PE, Hosch SB, Erbersdobler A, Klein CA, Izbicki JR, Knoefel WT, Stoecklein NH. \u00b6 Abstract Here we tested the prognostic impact of genomic alterations in operable localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Fifty-two formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded primary PDAC were laser micro-dissected and were investigated by comparative genomic hybridization after whole genome amplification using an adapter-linker PCR. Chromosomal gains and losses were correlated to clinico-pathological parameters and clinical follow-up data. The most frequent aberration was loss on chromosome 17p (65%) while the most frequent gains were detected at 2q (41%) and 8q (41%), respectively. The concomitant occurrence of losses at 9p and 17p was found to be statistically significant. Higher rates of chromosomal losses were associated with a more advanced primary tumor stage and losses at 9p and 18q were significantly associated with presence of lymphatic metastasis (chi-square: p = 0.03, p = 0.05, respectively). Deletions on chromosome 4 were of prognostic significance for overall survival and tumor recurrence (Cox-multivariate analysis: p = 0.026 and p = 0.021, respectively).

Besides specifically targeting well-known, canonical oncogenes, CNAs may also play more subtle roles in terms of modulating genetic potential and broad gene expression patterns of developing tumors. Any significant differences in the overall CNA patterns between different cancer types may thus point towards specific biological mechanisms acting in those cancers. In addition, differences among CNA profiles may prove valuable for cancer classifications beyond existing annotation systems. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have analyzed molecular-cytogenetic data from 25579 tumors samples, which were classified into 160 cancer types according to the International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding system. When correcting for differences in the overall CNA frequencies between cancer types, related cancers were often found to cluster together according to similarities in their CNA profiles. Based on a randomization approach, distance measures from the cluster dendrograms were used to identify those specific genomic regions that contributed significantly to this signal. This approach identified 43 non-neutral genomic regions whose propensity for the occurrence of copy number alterations varied with the type of cancer at hand. Only a subset of these identified loci overlapped with previously implied, highly recurrent (hot-spot) cytogenetic imbalance regions. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, for many genomic regions, a simple null-hypothesis of independence between cancer type and relative copy number alteration frequency can be rejected. Since a subset of these regions display relatively low overall CNA frequencies, they may point towards second-tier genomic targets that are adaptively relevant but not necessarily essential for cancer development.","title":"Specific genomic..."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2012-01-01-Specific-genomic/#specific-genomic-regions-are-differentially-affected-by-copy-number-alterations-across-distinct-cancer-types-in-aggregated-cytogenetic-data","text":"","title":"Specific genomic regions are differentially affected by copy number alterations across distinct cancer types, in aggregated cytogenetic data."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2012-01-01-arrayMap-a/","text":"arrayMap: a reference resource for genomic copy number imbalances in human malignancies. \u00b6 Cai H, Kumar N, Baudis M. \u00b6 Abstract BACKGROUND: The delineation of genomic copy number abnormalities (CNAs) from cancer samples has been instrumental for identification of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes and proven useful for clinical marker detection.

Searches of MEDLINE, Pubmed, and EMBASE--after the original description of comparative genomic hybridization in 1992 and July 2010--identified 15 case series of patients with CNS-PNET and tumors of the pineal region whose tumors were investigated for genome-wide CNA. One additional case study was identified from contact with experts. Individual patient data were extracted from publications or obtained from investigators, and CNAs were converted to a digitized format suitable for data mining and subgroup identification. Summary profiles for genomic imbalances were generated from case-specific data. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and by univariable and multivariable Cox regression models. In their overall CNA profiles, low grade tumors of the pineal region clearly diverged from CNS-PNET and pineoblastoma. At a median follow-up of 89 months, 7-year OS rates of CNS-PNET, pineoblastoma, and low grade tumors of the pineal region were 22.9 \u00b1 6, 0 \u00b1 0, and 87.5 \u00b1 12 %, respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that histology (CNS-PNET), age (\u22642.5 years), and possibly recurrent CNAs were associated with unfavorable OS. DNA copy number profiling suggests a close relationship between CNS-PNET and pineoblastoma. Low grade tumors of the pineal region differed from CNS-PNET and pineoblastoma. Due to their high biological and clinical variability, a coordinated prospective validation in future studies is necessary to establish robust risk factors.","title":"DNA copy number..."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2012-09-01-DNA-copy-number/#dna-copy-number-alterations-in-central-primitive-neuroectodermal-tumors-and-tumors-of-the-pineal-region-an-international-individual-patient-data-meta-analysis","text":"","title":"DNA copy number alterations in central primitive neuroectodermal tumors and tumors of the pineal region: an international individual patient data meta-analysis."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2012-09-01-Improved-multiplex/","text":"Improved multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis identifies a deleterious PMS2 allele generated by recombination with crossover between PMS2 and PMS2CL. \u00b6 Wernstedt A, Valtorta E, Armelao F, Togni R, Girlando S, Baudis M, Heinimann K, Messiaen L, Staehli N, Zschocke J, Marra G, Wimmer K. \u00b6 Abstract Heterozygous PMS2 germline mutations are associated with Lynch syndrome. Up to one third of these mutations are genomic deletions. Their detection is complicated by a pseudogene (PMS2CL), which--owing to extensive interparalog sequence exchange--closely resembles PMS2 downstream of exon 12. A recently redesigned multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay identifies PMS2 copy number alterations with improved reliability when used with reference DNAs containing equal numbers of PMS2- and PMS2CL-specific sequences. We selected eight such reference samples--all publicly available--and used them with this assay to study 13 patients with PMS2-defective colorectal tumors. Three presented deleterious alterations: an Alu-mediated exon deletion; a 125-kb deletion encompassing PMS2 and four additional genes (two with tumor-suppressing functions); and a novel deleterious hybrid PMS2 allele produced by recombination with crossover between PMS2 and PMS2CL, with the breakpoint in intron 10 (the most 5' breakpoint of its kind reported thus far). We discuss mechanisms that might generate this allele in different chromosomal configurations (and their diagnostic implications) and describe an allele-specific PCR assay that facilitates its detection.

It is not clear in detail which signaling pathways or networks regulate the induction of either apoptosis or senescence. Primary human fibroblasts are able to withstand high doses of irradiation and to prevent irradiation-induced apoptosis. However, the underlying regulatory basis for this phenotype is not well understood. Here, a kinetic network analysis based on reverse phase protein arrays (RPPAs) in combination with extensive western blot and cell culture analyses was employed to decipher the cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling networks and to identify possible antiapoptotic pathways. This analysis identified activation of known DNA damage response pathways (e.g., phosphorylation of MKK3/6, p38, MK2, Hsp27, p53 and Chk1) as well as of prosurvival (e.g., MEK-ERK, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), protein kinase C (PKC)) and antiapoptotic markers (e.g., Bad, Bcl-2). Interestingly, PKC family members were activated early upon irradiation, suggesting a regulatory function in the ionizing radiation (IR) response of these cells. Inhibition or downregulation of PKC in primary human fibroblasts caused IR-dependent downregulation of the identified prosurvival (CREB phosphorylation) and antiapoptotic (Bad phosphorylation, Bcl-2) markers and thus lead to a proliferation stop and to apoptosis. Taken together, our analysis suggests that cytoplasmic PKC signaling conditions IR-stressed MRC-5 and IMR-90 cells to prevent irradiation-induced apoptosis.

More recently, mutations in the SIL1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum resident co-chaperone, were identified as the main cause of Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. Here we describe the results of SIL1 mutation analysis in 62 patients presenting with early-onset ataxia, cataracts and myopathy or combinations of at least two of these. We obtained a mutation detection rate of 60% (15/25) among patients with the characteristic Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome triad (ataxia, cataracts, myopathy) whereas the detection rate in the group of patients with more variable phenotypic presentation was below 3% (1/37). We report 16 unrelated families with a total of 19 different SIL1 mutations. Among these mutations are 15 previously unreported changes, including single- and multi-exon deletions. Based on data from our screening cohort and data compiled from the literature we found that SIL1 mutations are invariably associated with the combination of a cerebellar syndrome and chronic myopathy. Cataracts were observed in all patients beyond the age of 7 years, but might be missing in infants. Six patients with SIL1 mutations had no intellectual disability, extending the known wide range of cognitive capabilities in Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome to include normal intelligence. Modestly constant features were somatic growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities and pyramidal tract signs. Examination of mutant SIL1 expression in cultured patient lymphoblasts suggested that SIL1 mutations result in severely reduced SIL1 protein levels irrespective of the type and position of mutations. Our data broaden the SIL1 mutation spectrum and confirm that SIL1 is the major Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome gene. SIL1 patients usually present with the characteristic triad but cataracts might be missing in young children. As cognitive impairment is not obligatory, patients without intellectual disability but a Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome-compatible phenotype should receive SIL1 mutation analysis. Despite allelic heterogeneity and many families with private mutations, the phenotype related to SIL1 mutations is relatively homogenous. Based on SIL1 expression studies we speculate that this may arise from a uniform effect of different mutations on protein expression.","title":"SIL1 mutations and..."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2013-12-01-SIL1-mutations-and/#sil1-mutations-and-clinical-spectrum-in-patients-with-marinesco-sjogren-syndrome","text":"","title":"SIL1 mutations and clinical spectrum in patients with Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Biopsying-parapsoria/","text":"Biopsying parapsoriasis: quo vadis? Are morphological stains enough or are ancillary tests needed? \u00b6 Baderca F, Chiticariu E, Baudis M, Solovan C. \u00b6 Abstract BACKGROUND: Parapsoriasis represents a group of cutaneous disorders that shows variable clinical aspects somehow resembling to psoriasis, how is reflecting by its name. It was first named by Brocq, in 1902, as an entity with three components: pityriasis lichenoides, small plaque parapsoriasis and large plaque parapsoriasis. Nowadays, under the name of parapsoriasis are included only the last two categories, that are considered disorders characterized by the presence of a mononuclear infiltrate in the dermis, composed of T-cells. Until now, there were not established pathognomonic histopathological features to diagnose parapsoriasis. AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate the epidemiological and morphological data of parapsoriasis cases diagnosed at Emergency City Hospital, Timisoara, Romania for a period of 12 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study had two parts; one was retrospective and another one prospective. For the retrospective part, we searched 210111 patient files recorded in our Pathology Service for a period of 11 years, from January 2002 to December 2012. The slides were searched from the archive and re-read by two individual pathologists. For prospective part of the study, we reviewed 11815 histological slides read between January and June 2013. After inspection of the recorded files, the pathologists noted, were available, the localization and number of the lesions, together with symptoms. The biopsied specimens were initially processed with routine histological technique, the archive slides being stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. While reading the slides, the pathologists paid attention to the architecture of the epidermis, the presence of epidermotropism and interface dermatitis, type of the dermal infiltrate and its distributions. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we emphasized the histopathological aspects of parapsoriasis in order to create a basic line that could help in the establishment of a uniformly accepted definition of parapsoriasis on histopathological grounds.","title":"Biopsying parapsoria..."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Biopsying-parapsoria/#biopsying-parapsoriasis-quo-vadis-are-morphological-stains-enough-or-are-ancillary-tests-needed","text":"","title":"Biopsying parapsoriasis: quo vadis?

This could provide an alternative paradigm in cancer development, replacing the gradual accumulation of genomic changes with a \"one-off\" catastrophic event. However, the term has been used with varying operational definitions, with the minimal consensus being a large number of locally clustered copy number aberrations. The mechanisms underlying these chromothripsis-like patterns (CTLP) and their specific impact on tumorigenesis are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we identified CTLP in 918 cancer samples, from a dataset of more than 22,000 oncogenomic arrays covering 132 cancer types. Fragmentation hotspots were found to be located on chromosome 8, 11, 12 and 17. Among the various cancer types, soft-tissue tumors exhibited particularly high CTLP frequencies. Genomic context analysis revealed that CTLP rearrangements frequently occurred in genomes that additionally harbored multiple copy number aberrations (CNAs). An investigation into the affected chromosomal regions showed a large proportion of arm-level pulverization and telomere related events, which would be compatible to a number of underlying mechanisms. We also report evidence that these genomic events may be correlated with patient age, stage and survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: Through a large-scale analysis of oncogenomic array data sets, this study characterized features associated with genomic aberrations patterns, compatible to the spectrum of \"chromothripsis\"-definitions as previously used. While quantifying clustered genomic copy number aberrations in cancer samples, our data indicates an underlying biological heterogeneity behind these chromothripsis-like patterns, beyond a well defined \"chromthripsis\" phenomenon.","title":"Chromothripsis-like..."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Chromothripsis-like/#chromothripsis-like-patterns-are-recurring-but-heterogeneously-distributed-features-in-a-survey-of-22347-cancer-genome-screens","text":"","title":"Chromothripsis-like patterns are recurring but heterogeneously distributed features in a survey of 22,347 cancer genome screens."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2014-01-01-Progenetix-12-years/","text":"Progenetix: 12 years of oncogenomic data curation. \u00b6 Cai H, Kumar N, Ai N, Gupta S, Rath P, Baudis M. \u00b6 Abstract DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) can be found in the majority of cancer genomes and are crucial for understanding the potential mechanisms underlying tumor initiation and progression. Since the first release in 2001, the Progenetix project ( www.progenetix.org ) has provided a reference resource dedicated to provide the most comprehensive collection of genome-wide CNA profiles. Reflecting the application of comparative genomic hybridization techniques to tens of thousands of cancer genomes, over the past 12 years our data curation efforts have resulted in a more than 60-fold increase in the number of cancer samples presented through Progenetix. In addition, new data exploration tools and visualization options have been added. In particular, the gene-specific CNA frequency analysis should facilitate the assignment of cancer genes to related cancer types. In addition, the new user file processing interface allows users to take advantage of the online tools, including various data representation options for proprietary data pre-publication.

As a consequence, the number of established cell lines used for experimental in vitro and in vivo osteosarcoma research is limited and the value of these cell lines relies on their stability during culture. Here we investigated the stability in gene expression by microarray analysis and array genomic hybridization of three low metastatic cell lines and derivatives thereof with increased metastatic potential using cells of different passages.The osteosarcoma cell lines showed altered gene expression during in vitro culture, and it was more pronounced in two metastatic cell lines compared to the respective parental cells. Chromosomal instability contributed in part to the altered gene expression in SAOS and LM5 cells with low and high metastatic potential. To identify metastasis-relevant genes in a background of passage-dependent altered gene expression, genes involved in \"Pathways in cancer\" that were consistently regulated under all passage comparisons were evaluated. Genes belonging to \"Hedgehog signaling pathway\" and \"Wnt signaling pathway\" were significantly up-regulated, and IHH, WNT10B and TCF7 were found up-regulated in all three metastatic compared to the parental cell lines.Considerable instability during culture in terms of gene expression and chromosomal aberrations was observed in osteosarcoma cell lines. The use of cells from different passages and a search for genes consistently regulated in early and late passages allows the analysis of metastasis-relevant genes despite the observed instability in gene expression in osteosarcoma cell lines during culture.","title":"Genomic instability..."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2015-01-01-Genomic-instability/#genomic-instability-of-osteosarcoma-cell-lines-in-culture-impact-on-the-prediction-of-metastasis-relevant-genes","text":"","title":"Genomic instability of osteosarcoma cell lines in culture: impact on the prediction of metastasis relevant genes."},{"location":"publications/2008-2015/2015-01-01-arrayMap-2014-an/","text":"arrayMap 2014: an updated cancer genome resource. \u00b6 Cai H, Gupta S, Rath P, Ai N, Baudis M. \u00b6 Abstract Somatic copy number aberrations (CNA) represent a mutation type encountered in the majority of cancer genomes.

We aim to identify DNA copy number and gene expression aberrations typical of different cutaneous pathologies. Another goal is the identification of circulating biomarkers both as prognostic, therapy- responsive and/or therapy-monitoring factors and as disease classifiers and subclassifiers. We established a complex biobank, the first as such in Romania, based on fresh frozen material and formalin fixed parafine embedded specimen, backed up by an exhaustive database with focus on cases of cutaneous lymphoma and inflammatory diseases, but also basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, melanomas. At present, the biobank contains 320 patients peripheral blood ,tissue samples and extracted DNA specimens , with full authorization of the donors for use in research activities and approval by ethic committees and authorities. An important feature of our genomic data analysis is the integration of molecular data generated during our studies to results deposited in genomic data repositories ( www.progenetix.net ). We expect a high level of impact of our research for the development of diagnostic tools and identification of candidate molecules for targeted therapies.","title":"A Biobank Supporting Rare Disease Research In Dermatopathology.
